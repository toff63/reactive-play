Forget it. It's too risky.

I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,200
You always say that,
the same thing every time.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,840
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,240
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right, too.

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,160
But you forget about it
in a day or two.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,600
Well, the days of me
forgetting are over...

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,760
and the days of me remembering
have just begun.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,080
You know when you go on
like this what you sound like?

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,120
I sound like
a sensible fucking man.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,080
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack...

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,960
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again...

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,680
since I'm never
gonna do it again...

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,920
you're never gonna
have to hear me quack...

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,280
about how I'm never
gonna do it again.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
After tonight.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,480
Correct.
I got all tonight to quack.

HONEYBUNNY:
Oh, yes. Thank you.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,600
You're welcome.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,280
I mean, the way it is now...

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,160
you're taking the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,120
You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

Why should they give a fuck?

He walks into a bank

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,320
He gives the phone
to the teller...

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,800
bloke on the other end
of the phone says...

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,240
"We got this guy's little girl.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,680
"If you don't give him
all your money...

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,280
- "we're gonna kill her."
- Did it work?

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,720

That's what I'm talking about!

40

Did they hurt the little girl?

41
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,720
I don't know. Probably never was
a girl in the first place.

42
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,040
The point isn't the girl.
The point is...

43
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,800
they robbed a bank
with a telephone.

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,400
You want to rob banks?

45
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,560
I'm not saying
I want to rob banks.

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,080
If we did, it would be easier
than what we been doing.

47

No more liquor stores?

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,200
What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,640
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be.

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,280
There's too many foreigners
own liquor stores.

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,920
Ha ha ha.
I've seen 'em do it, man.

171
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,520
They fucking drown 'em
in that shit.

172
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,120
Yuck.

173
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,320
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

174
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,160
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

175
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,120
That's counting our guy?

176
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,760
I'm not sure.

177
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,160
So that means it could be
up to five guys up there?

178
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,920
It's possible.

179
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
We should have fucking shotguns.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,040
- VINCENT: What's her name?
- JULES: Mia.

181
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,920
Mia. How did Marsellus
and her meet?

182
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,040
I don't know.
However people meet people.

183
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,640
She used to be an actress.

184
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, really? She do anything
I'd have seen?

185
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,840
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

186
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,280
Pilot? What's a pilot?

187
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,400
Well, you know the shows on TV?

188
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
I don't watch TV.

189
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,600
Yeah, but you are aware...

190
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,280
that there's an invention
called television...

191
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,440
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

192
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,520
Yeah.

193
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,400
The way they pick TV shows,
they make one show.

194
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,840
That show's called a pilot.

195
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,080
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

196
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
and on the strength
of that one show...

197
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,320
they decide if they want
to make more shows.

198
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,880
Some get chosen
and become television programs.

199
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,440
Some don't, become nothing.

200
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,240
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

201
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,320
You remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan...

202
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,480
used to call him
"Tony Rocky Horror"?

203
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

204
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,880
I wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat.

205
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,320
I mean, he got a weight problem.

206
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,760
What's the nigger gonna do,
he's Samoan.

207
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Yeah, I think I know
who you mean. What about him?

208
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,960
Well,
Marsellus fucked him up good.

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,400
Word around the campfire is...

210
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,600
it was on account
of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

[Elevator motor engages]

213
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,400
So, what'd he do, fuck her?

214
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,720
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing that bad.

215
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,320
Well, then, what, then?

216
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,120
Gave her a foot massage.

217
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,520
- A foot massage? That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

218
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,680
Then what did Marsellus do?

219
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,400
Sent a couple of cats
over to his place.

220
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,480
They took him out on his patio,
threw his ass over the balcony.

Nigger fell four stories.

222
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,320
They had a little garden
down at the bottom...

223
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,480
enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

224
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,680
Nigger fell through that.

225
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,640
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

226
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,480
That's a damn shame.

229

But still, I have to say...

230
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,360
you play with matches,
you get burned.

231
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,520
What do you mean?

232
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,600
You don't be giving
Marsellus Wallace's new bride...

233
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,920
a foot massage.

234
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,520
You don't think he overreacted?

235
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,840
Well, Antwan probably
didn't expect Marsellus...

236
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

237
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,360
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothing.

238
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,880
I give my mother a foot massage.

239
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,880
No, it's laying hands
in a familiar way...

240
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,520
on Marsellus' new wife.

241
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,080
I mean, is it as bad
as eating her pussy out?

242
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,320
No, but it's
the same fucking ballpark.

243
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop right there.

244
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Eating a bitch out and giving
a bitch a foot massage...

245
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,280
ain't even
the same fucking thing.

246
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,920
It's not.
It's the same ballpark.

247
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,880
Ain't no fucking ballpark,
neither.

248
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine...

249
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,640
but you know
touching his wife's feet...

250
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,360
and sticking your tongue
in her holiest of holies...

251
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,920
ain't the same fucking ballpark.
It ain't the same league.

It ain't even
the same fucking sport.

a foot massage?

about foot massages.

Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

261
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,720
Fuck you.

You best back off.

a little pissed here.

Just 'cause I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage...

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,840
don't make it right
for Marsellus...

to throw Antwan
off a building...

into a glass

fucking up the way the nigger
talks. That shit ain't right.

he better paralyze my ass...

- you know what I'm saying?
- I ain't saying it's right.

don't mean nothing...

and I'm saying it does.

I've given a million ladies
a million foot massages...

283
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,400
and they all meant something.

284

Now, we act like they don't,
but they do.

285

That's what's so fucking cool
about 'em.

going on where, you know...

you don't talk about it, but you
know it, and she knows it.

better known better.

of humor about this shit.

of her while he's gone.

- No, man. Just take her out.

- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000

caught you boys at breakfast.

- Hamburgers.
- Hamburgers!

of any nutritious breakfast.

328

Ch-ch-cheeseburgers.

329

JULES: No, no, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em?

330
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,680
McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack-in-the-Box, where?

331
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,920
Um, Big Kahuna Burger.

332
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,720
Big Kahuna Burger. That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.

333

some tasty burgers.

How are they?

- Yeah.

509
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,120
My nigger.
Get your ass over here.

510
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,640
AL GREEN SINGING:
You'd never do that to me

511
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,760
- What's up?
- I'm sorry.

512
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,520
MARSELLUS:
Don't worry about it.

513
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,280
PAUL: Pack of Red Apples.
$1.40.

514
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
And some matches.

515
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,760
AL GREEN SINGING:
Here's what I want to do

516
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,960
Hey

517
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,520
We ought to stay together

518
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,040
WOMAN: It's as if it turns...

519
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,880
every part of your body
into the tip of a penis.

520
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,320
Wow.

521
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,880
I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

522
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,720
SECOND WOMAN: Well, you see
how they use that gun...

523
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,160
to pierce your ears?

524
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,040
They don't use that to pierce
your nipples, too, do they?

525
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,200
Forget that gun.

526
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,720
That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

527
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,520
WOMAN: All my piercing,
eighteen places on my body...

528
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,760
every one of 'em
done with a needle.

529
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,880
Five in each ear. One through
the nipple of my left breast.

530
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,960
WOMAN: Two in my right nostril.
One in my left eyebrow.

531
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,640
One in my belly. One in my lip.
One in my clit.

532
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,880
And I wear a stud in my tongue.

533
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,200
VINCENT: Excuse me.

534
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,560
I was just curious, but, um...

535
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,960
why would you wear a stud
in your tongue?

536
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,320
It's a sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

537
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,240
Vincenzo. Step into my office.

538
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,840
[Door closes]

539
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,360
LANCE: This is Panda,
from Mexico.

540
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,760
Very good stuff.
Now, that's Bava.

541
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,440
Different, but equally good.

542
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,840
And that is Choco, from
the Hartz Mountains of Germany.

543
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,560
Now, the first two
are the same...

544
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,600
300 a gram.
Those are friend prices.

545
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,080
But this one
is a little more expensive.

546
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,440
LANCE: This is 500 a gram,
but when you shoot it...

547
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,560
you will know
where that extra money went.

548
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,040
Now, there's nothing wrong
with these two.

549
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,600
This is real, real,
real good shit.

550
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,120
But this one
is a fucking madman.

551
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,520
Remember,
I just got back from Amsterdam.

552
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,160
[Chuckles] Am I a nigger?

553
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,360
Are we in Inglewood?
No. You're in my home.

554
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,080
Now, white people
who know the difference...

555
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,040
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

556
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
Now, my shit,
I'll take the Pepsi Challenge...

557
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,040
with that Amsterdam shit
any old day of the fucking week.

558
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,640
That's a bold statement.

559
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,480
[Chuckles]
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.

560
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,360
This is a seller's market.

561
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,240
Coke is fucking dead as... dead.

562
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,160
Heroin is coming back
in a big fucking way.

563
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,080
All right,
give me three grams of madman.

564
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,920
If it's as good
as you say it is...

565
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,520
I'll come back
and buy another thousand.

566
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,400
Well, I just hope that I still
have some left for you.

567
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,720
But... I'm giving you some
out of my own private stash.

568
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,560
That is what a nice guy I am.

569
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,520
Hey, I'm out of balloons.
Is a baggie all right?

570
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,960
Yeah, that's cool.

571
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,680
All right.
I'll just get one for you.

572
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,600
Honey,
will you get me some baggies...

573
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,440
and, uh,
twistix from the kitchen?

574
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,400
WOMAN: OK.

575
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,360
Hey, uh,
what do you think about Trudi?

576
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,800
She ain't got a boyfriend.

577
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,840
You want to, uh,
hang out, get high?

578
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,320
Which one is Trudi?

579
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,240
The one with all the shit
in her face.

580
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,560
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

582
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,840
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

583
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,520
[Chuckles] No, I can't.
Um, I gotta be someplace.

584
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,960
All right. No problemo.

585
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,680
- I'll take a rain check.

Ah, man. You know what some

- Fucking keyed it.

590
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,800
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- VINCENT: Tell me about it.

591
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,960
I had it in storage for 3 years.
It was out 5 days...

592
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,640
and some dickless piece of shit
fucked with it.

593

LANCE: They should be
fucking killed, man.

594
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,320
No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.

00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,840
VINCENT: Boy, I wish
I could've caught him doing it.

596
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,600
I'd have given anything
to catch that asshole doing it.

597
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,440
VINCENT: It'a been worth him
doing it...

598
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,000
just so I could've caught him
doing it.

599
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,080
- What a fucker!
- What's more chicken shit...

600
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,560
than fucking
with a man's automobile?

601
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,760
I mean, don't fuck
with another man's vehicle.

602
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,000
- You don't do it.
- It's just against the rules.

603
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,880
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

What do you think?

701
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,680
I think it's like a wax museum
with a pulse.

702
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,560
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

Let's see.
Steak, steak, steak.

704

Yeah, the Douglas Sirk steak.
I'll have that.

705
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,720
How do you want that cooked?

706
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,160
Burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

707
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,480
Bloody as hell, and oh, yeah,

Did you just order
a $5.00 shake?

715
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
Mm-hmm.

716
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,440
That's a shake.
That's milk and ice cream.

717

- MIA: Last I heard.
- That's $5.00?

718

You don't put bourbon in it
or nothin'?

719

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,320
roll me one of those, cowboy?

725
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,160
You can have this one, cowgirl.

726

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,840
MIA: So... Marsellus said you
just got back from Amsterdam.

732
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,400
- Sure did.
- MIA: How long were you there?

733
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,360
[Sniffs] Just over three years.

734
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,560
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

735
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,120
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

736
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,000
Why would you?

737
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,400
I heard you did a pilot.

738
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,600
That was my fifteen minutes.

739
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,160
What was it?

740
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,920
It was a show about a team
of female secret agents...

741
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,720
called "Fox Force Five."

742
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,280
- What?
- MIA: "Fox Force Five."

743
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,640
Fox, as in we're
a bunch of foxy chicks.

744
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,080
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

745
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,800
And Five, as in there's one,
two, three, four, five of us.

746
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,240
MIA: There was a blond one...
Sommerset O'Neal.

747
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,680
She was the leader.

748
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,400
The Japanese Fox
was a kung-fu master.

749
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,160
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

750
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,240
French Fox's specialty was sex.

751
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,800
What was your specialty?

752
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,480
Knives.

753
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,280
MIA: Character I played,
Raven McCoy...

754
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,320
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

755
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,760
According to the show...

756
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,440
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife...

757
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,200
and she knew
a zillion old jokes.

758
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,000
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

759
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
And if we would've
got picked up...

760
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,440
they would've worked in
a gimmick where every show...

761
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,240
I would've told another joke.

762
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,080
You know any of them old jokes?

763
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,480
Well, I only got the chance
to say one...

764
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,720
'cause we only did one show.

765
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,080
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,880
VINCENT: Don't be that way.
Tell me.

767
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,240
No. You wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

768
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,720
VINCENT: You'd be em...

769
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,560

and you can't tell me?

VINCENT:
I promise I won't laugh.

771
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,360
That's what I'm afraid of,
Vince.

772
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,640
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

773
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,520
Well, now I'm definitely
not gonna tell you...

774
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,000
'cause it's been
built up too much.

Mmm. Yummy.

779
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,560
You think
I could have a sip of that?

Be my guest.

781
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,960
I gotta know what a $5.00 shake
tastes like.

782
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

783
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,280
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties, I can handle.

784
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,080
All right.

785
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,640
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake.

Told you.

787
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,560
I don't know
if it was worth $5.00...

788
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,040
but it was pretty fucking good.

789
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,840
Don't you hate that?

790
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,440
Hate what?

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,760

MIA: Why do we feel
it's necessary...

793
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,040
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?

794
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,720
I don't know,
but it's a good question.

795
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,480
That's when you know you've
found somebody really special...

796
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,840
when you can just
shut the fuck up for a minute...

797
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,080
and comfortably share a silence.

798
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,560
Well, I don't think
we're quite there yet...

799

but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

800
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,280
I'll tell you what.

801
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,440
I'm going to go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

802
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,840
You sit here
and think of something to say.

803
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,960
I'll do that.

804
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,000
OK.

from the bathroom...

00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,200
to find your food
waiting for you?

815
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,600
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

816
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,000
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

817
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,400
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

818
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,880
Would you like some coffee?

819
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,320
Which one? There's two Monroes.

820
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,000
VINCENT: No, there's not.
That is Marilyn Monroe.

821
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,800
That is Mamie Van Doren.

822

And I don't see
Jayne Mansfield.

823
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480

- Pretty smart.
- Yeah, I got my moments.

825
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,600
So, did you think
of somethin' to say?

00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,680
Actually, I did.

827
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,200
However...

828
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,400
You seem like
a really nice person...

829

and I don't want to offend you.

830
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,760

the usual mindless, boring...

832

That sounds like you actually
have somethin' to say.

VINCENT: Well, well, I do.
I do.

834
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,320
But you have to promise
not to be offended.

835
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,800
MIA: No! No, no, no.

836
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,000
You can't promise
somethin' like that.

837
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,440
I have no idea
what you're gonna ask me...

838
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,520
so you can go ahead and ask me
what you're gonna ask me...

839
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,480
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

840
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,920
Then,
through no fault of my own...

841
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,400
- I would've broken my promise.
- Let's just forget it.

842
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,000
That's an impossibility.

843

Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this...

844
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,440
would be an exercise
in futility.

845

Is that a fact?

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,240
What did you, uh, think about
what happened to Antwan?

850
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,360
Who's Antwan?

851
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,600
Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

852
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,120
He fell out of a window.

853
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,480
Mmm. Mmm.
Well, that is one way to say it.

854
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,080
Another way to say it
would be that he was thrown out.

855
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,440
Another way would be was he was
thrown out by Marsellus...

856
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,400
and yet even another way
is to say...

857
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
he was thrown of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

858
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,840
Is that a fact?

859
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,720
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

860
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,560
- It's just what I heard.
- Who told you?

861
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,400
VINCENT: They.

862
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,160
They talk a lot, don't they?

863
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,200
[Chuckles]

864
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,880
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

865
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,800
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

866
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,560
Well, I'm not... I'm not shy.
Um...

867
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,640
MIA:
Did it involve the "F" word?

868
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,080
No. No, no, no.

869
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,520
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

870
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,520
- And?
- And... and nothin'. That's it.

871
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,720
You heard Marsellus
threw Tony Rocky Horror...

872
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,920
out of a four-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

873
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,560
- VINCENT: Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

874
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,800
[Chuckles] Well, I mean...

875
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,000
at the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

876
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,760
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a four-story window...

877
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,360
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

878
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,800
No, it seemed excessive...

879
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,640
but that doesn't mean it didn't
happen. I mean, I understand...

880
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,040
that Marsellus is very,
very protective of you.

881
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,120
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

882
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,920
A husband
almost killing another man...

883
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,200
for touching his wife's feet
is something else.

884
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,040
But did it happen?

885
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,760
MIA: Only thing Antwan
ever touched of mine...

886
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,480
was my hand when he shook it...
at my wedding.

887
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,880
Really?

888
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,800
Truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus...

889
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,320
threw Tony out of
that four-story window...

890
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,480
except Marsellus and Tony.

891
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,480
But when you little scamps
get together...

892
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,040
you're worse
than a sewing circle.

893
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,280
ED SULLIVAN:
Ladies and gentlemen...

899
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,920
Now, who'll be
our first contestants?

900
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,360
Right here!

901
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,680

- I wanna dance.

MIA: No, no, no, no, no, no.

904
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,840
I do believe Marsellus...
my husband, your boss...

905
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,520
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

906
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,080
Now I want to dance.
I want to win.

907
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,920
I want that trophy,
so dance good.

908
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,360
All right. You asked for it.

909
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,880
Let's hear it

All right. Let's see
what you can do. Take it away!

00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,640

CHUCK BERRY SINGING:
It was a teenage wedding

921
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,600
And the old folks
wished 'em well

922
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,960
You could see that Pierre

923
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,440
Did truly love the mademoiselle

924
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,480
And now the young
monsieur and Madame

925
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,400
Have rung the chapel bell

926
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,040
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

927
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,240
It goes to show
you never can tell

928
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,680
They furnished off
an apartment

929
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,280
With a two-room Roebuck sale

930
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,480
The coolerator was crammed

931
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,000
With TV dinners and ginger ale

932
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,160
But when Pierre found work

933
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,400
The little money comin'
worked out well

934
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,360
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

935
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,720
It goes to show
you never can tell

936
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,240
They had a hi-fi phono

937
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,360
Boy, did they let it blast

938
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,080
700 little records

939
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,440
All rock, rhythm, and jazz

940
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,640
But when the sun went down

941
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,120
The rapid tempo
of the music fell

942
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,880
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

943
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,040
It goes to show

Ha ha ha!

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,640
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

952
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,800
I don't know what you call that.

I'm gonna take a piss.

That's a little bit
more information...

00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,760

you can maintain loyalty.

straight to her heart,
but she's got a breastplate.

No! You don't gotta stab her
three times. Just once.

But hard enough to get through
her breastplate into her heart.

you press down on the plunger.

Well, I'm of the opinion...

1201
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,600
that if Marsellus
lived his whole life...

1202
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,800
he don't need to know nothin'
about this incident.

by your great-grandfather...

1264
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,200
during the First World War.

1265
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,440
It was bought
in a little general store...

1266
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,720
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

1267
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,280
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

1268
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,360
Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

1269
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,560
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

1270
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,080
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

1271
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,200
This was your great-
grandfather's war watch...

1272
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,680
and he wore it every day
he was in that war.

1273
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,960
and when he'd done his duty...

1274
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,160
he went home
to your great-grandmother...

1275
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,440
took the watch off...

1276
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,360
put it in an old coffee can...

1277
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,680
and in that can it stayed...

1278
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,320
KOONS: till your granddad,
Dane Coolidge...

1279
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,840
was called upon
by his country...

1280
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,640
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

1281
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,160
This time they called it
World War II.

1282

Your great-grandfather
gave this watch...

1283
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,040
to your granddad for good luck.

1284
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,000
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

1285
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,520
Dane was a marine,
and he was killed...

1286
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,280
along with all the other marines
at the Battle of Wake Island.

1287

had any illusions...

1290
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,480
about ever leaving
that island alive...

1291
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,480
so, three days before
the Japanese took the island...

1292
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,480
your granddad asked a gunner
on an Air Force transport...

1293
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,840

1294
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,280
a man he had never met
before in his life...

1295
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,440
to deliver to his infant son...

1296
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,480
who he had never seen
in the flesh...

1297
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,960
his gold watch.

1298
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,040
Three days later,
your granddad was dead...

1299
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,000
but Winocki kept his word.

After the war was over...

1301
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,280

1305

was on your daddy's wrist...

1306
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,080
when he was shot down
over Hanoi.

1307
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,480
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

1308
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,440
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch...

1309
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,840
they'd confiscate it...

1310
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,080
take it away.

1311
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:44,480
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

1312
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,120
He'd be damned if any slopes
put their greasy yellow hands...

1313
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,320
on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it...

1314
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,160
in one place he knew he could
hide somethin'... his ass.

1315
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,600
Five long years he wore
this watch up his ass.

1316
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,560
Then he died of dysentery,
he give me the watch.

1317
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,200
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass, two years.

01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,400
No, we don't wanna think,
we wanna know.

1364
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,440
Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

1365
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,160
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

1366
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,600
Butch's search...
how do you want it done?

1367
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,240
I'm prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker.

1368
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,920
If Butch goes to Indochina...

1369
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,400
I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice...

1370
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,160
ready to pop a cap
in his ass.

1371
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,080
I will take care of it.

1372
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,320
[Car driving]

1373
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,880
[Colombian accent]
Mister?

1374
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,040
ESMARELDA: Hey, mister?

1375
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,040
What?

1376
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,800
You were in that fight.

1377
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,680
ESMARELDA:
The fight on the radio.

1378
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,120
You're the fighter?

1379
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,040
Now, what gave you that idea?

1380
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:15,480
No, ho, come on.

1381
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,680
You're him.

1382
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,160
ESMARELDA:
I know you're him.

1383
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,600
Tell me you're him.

1384
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,280
I'm him.

1385
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,800
ESMARELDA: You killed
the other boxing man.

1386
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,440
He's dead?

1387
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,720
ESMARELDA:
The radio said he was dead.

1388
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,600
[Sighs, sniffs]

1389
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,600
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1390
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,920
[Butch sniffs]

1391
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,360
What does it feel like?

1392
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,480
What does what feel like?

1393
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,400
Killing a man.

1394
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:54,240
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1395
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,840
Are you a weirdo?

1396
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,400
[Chuckles]
No.

1397
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,880
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

1398
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,440
You are the first person
I've met...

1399
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,160
who has killed somebody.

1400
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,520
So...

1401
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,400
what does it feel like
to kill a man?

1402
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,320
[Sniffs, exhales]
I'll tell you what.

1403
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,120
You give me one of them
cigarettes you got up there...

1404
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,920
and I'll tell you all about it.

1405
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,800
[Butch sighs]

1406
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,520
BUTCH: So...

1407
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,120
Esmarelda...

1408
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,320
Villalobos.

1409
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,440
Is that Mexican?

1410
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,640
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

1411
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,240
That's some handle
you got there, honey.

1412
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,160
Thank you.

1413
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,760
And what is your name?

1414
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,480
Butch.

1415
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,840
Butch.

1416
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,240
What does it mean?

1417
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,000
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1418
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,320
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda.

1419
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,320
What is it you wanna know?

1420
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,600
I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.

1421
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,080
BUTCH:
I couldn't tell ya.

1422
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,840
I didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

1423
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,760
Now that I know he's dead...

1424
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,640
you wanna know
how I feel about it?

1425
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,120
I don't feel the least bit bad
about it.

1426
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,480
[Speech inaudible]

1427
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
What the fuck I tell ya, huh?

1428
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,160
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man...

1429
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,080
the odds went through the roof.

1430
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,720
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1431
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,160
Hey, fuck him, Scotty.

1432
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,400
If he was a better boxer,
he'd still be alive.

1433
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,600
He never laced up his gloves...

1434
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,280
which he never shoulda done
in the first fuckin' place...

1435
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,160
he'd still be alive.

1436
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,440
[Spits]

1437
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,320
Yeah, well...

1438
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,360
who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1439
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,920
Well, enough about the poor
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1440
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,640
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1441
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,560
How many bookies
you lay it around on?

1442
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,000
All eight?

1443
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,960
How long to collect?

1444
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,720
[Sniffs] So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night?

1445
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,000
No, I understand,
a few stragglers aside.

1446
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,720
Oh, fuck, Scotty,
that is good news...

1447
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,880
that is great news, man.

1448
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,400
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1449
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,040
No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1450
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,120
It'll probably take us a couple
of days to get to Knoxville.

1451
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,800
OK, my brother.

1452
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,200
[Chuckles]

1453
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,320
You're right.
You're goddamn right.

1454
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,400
All right, Scotty.

1455
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,760
Next time I see you,
we'll be on Tennessee time.

1456
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,160
Be cool, brother.

1457
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,360
[Tires squeal]

1458
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,320
[Engine running]

1459
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,480
45.60.

1460
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:12,240
And, uh, here's a little...
somethin' for the effort.

1461
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,400
Now...

1462
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,160
if anybody asks you
who your fare was tonight...

1463
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,280
what are you gonna say?

1464
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,600
The truth.

1465
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,280
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1466
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,720
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villalobos.

1467
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,120
Buenas noches, Butch.

1468
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,720
[Sighs]

1469
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,880
FABIENNE: [French accent]
Keep the light off.

1470
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,840
BUTCH: Is that better,
sugar pop?

1471
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,800
Oui.

1472
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,920
FABIENNE:
Hard day at the office?

1473
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,800
Pretty hard.

1474
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,080
I got in a fight.

1475
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,360
Poor baby.

1476
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,080
Can we make spoons?

1477
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,640
You know what? I was thinkin'
about takin' a shower.

1478
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,320
I'm stinkin' like a dog
over here.

1479
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,640
Mmm. I like the way you stink.

1480
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,520
Let me take this jacket off.

1481
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,160
I was looking at myself
in the mirror.

1482
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,480
Uh-huh.

1483
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,920
I wish I had a pot.

1484
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,200
You were lookin' at yourself
in the mirror...

1485
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,880
and you wish you had some pot?

1486
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,800
A pot.

1487
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,760
A pot belly.

1488
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,880
Pot bellies are sexy.

1489
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,720
Well, you should be happy...

1490
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,200
'cause you have one.

1491
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,520
[Chuckling]
Shut up, fatso!

1492
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,520
I don't have a pot.

1493
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,240
I have a bit of a tummy...

1494
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,120
like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star."

1495
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,560
It's not the same thing.

1496
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,320
I didn't know
there was such a difference...

1497
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,240
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1498
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,760
The difference is huge.

1499
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,040
[Kisses]

1500
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,240
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

1501
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,040
No. Pot bellies make a man...

1502
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,720
look either oafish
or like a gorilla.

1503
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,600
But on a woman,
a pot belly is very sexy.

1504
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,920
The rest of you is normal.

1505
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,120
Normal face, normal legs,
normal hips, normal ass...

1506
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,280
but with a big perfectly
round pot belly.

1507
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,640
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1508
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,240
to accentuate it.

1509
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,120
You think men
would find that attractive?

1510
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,000
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1511
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,400
It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch...

1512
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,520
and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same.

1513
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,280
[Sighs]

1514
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,200
If you had a pot belly...

1515
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,120
I would punch you in it.

1516
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,560
- You'd punch me in my belly?
- Right in the belly.

1517
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,560
Ah! I'd smother you.

1518
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,920
I'd drop it right on your face
till you couldn't breathe.

1519
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,920
[Butch laughing]

1520
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,880
You'd do that?

1521
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,400
Yes. Yes.

1522
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,560
[Moans]

1523
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,000
[Moaning]

1524
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,640
[Both moan, both laugh]

1525
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,440
Did you get everything?

1526
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,960
Yes, I did.

1527
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,080
BUTCH: Good job, sugar pop.

1528
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,280
Did everything go as planned?

1529
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,360
You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1530
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,720
[Fabienne chuckles]

1531
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,880
You didn't listen to the radio?

1532
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,840
I never listen to your fights.

1533
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,120
Were you the winner?

1534
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,400
I won, all right.

1535
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,000
FABIENNE:
Are you still retiring?

1536
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,280

We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1541
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,680
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1542
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,240
But they won't find us,
will they?

1543

Do you still want me
to go with you?

"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

"and the finder
of lost children.

Uhh!

2080
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,920
Aah!

2081
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,640
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

2082
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,800
VINCENT:
Is he a friend of yours?

2083
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,600
JULES: Oh, Vincent, Marvin.
Marvin, Vincent.

2084
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:23,760
VINCENT: Better tell him
to shut the fuck up.

2085
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,200
He's getting on my nerves.

2086
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,400
JULES: Marvin. Marvin!

2087
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,200
I'd knock that shit off
if I was you.

2088
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:30,160
[Door opens]

2089
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:33,200
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

2090
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,480
[Gun clicking]

2091
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:03,440
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

2092
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,840
Slip your mind?

2093
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,280
You forget someone was in there
with a goddamn hand-cannon?

2094
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,240
You see the size
of that gun he fired at us?

2095
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:12,680
It was bigger than him.

2096
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:19,400
We should be fucking dead, man.

2097
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,320
VINCENT:
I know. We was lucky.

2098
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:24,280
JULES: No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

2099
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,640
Yeah, maybe.

2100
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:28,440
This was divine intervention.

2101
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,360
You know what
divine intervention is?

2102
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,320
I think so.

2103
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:39,720
That means that God
came down from Heaven...

2104
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,120
and stopped the bullets.

2105
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:43,560
JULES: That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

2106
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:44,800
God came down from Heaven...

2107
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,520
and stopped
these motherfucking bullets.

2108
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:49,560
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

2109
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:51,920
Don't do that. Don't
fucking blow this shit off.

2110
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,080
JULES: What just happened here
was a fucking miracle.

2111
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:55,800
VINCENT: Chill, Jules.
This shit happens.

2112
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,560
Wrong. Wrong.
This shit doesn't just happen.

2113
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:00,640
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion...

2114
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:04,160
in a car or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

2115
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:05,960
We should be fucking dead,
my friend.

2116
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,800
JULES: What happened here
was a miracle...

2117
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,040
and I want you to fucking
acknowledge it.

2118
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,120
All right, it was a miracle.

2119
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,640
Can we go now?

2120
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,080
Let's go, nigger. Come on.

2121
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,560
Shit.

2122
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:29,760
VINCENT: You ever seen
that show "Cops"?

2123
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,840
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on...

2124
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,560
and he was talking
about this gunfight...

2125
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,480
he had in a hallway
with this guy, right?

2126
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:37,440
And he just unloaded
on this guy...

2127
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:39,200
and nothing happened.
He didn't hit nothing.

2128
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:41,680
OK? It was just him
and this guy.

2129
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:43,320
I mean, you know...

2130
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,360
it's freaky, but it happens.

2131
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:47,800
You want to play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd...

2132
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,160
but me, my eyes
are wide fucking open.

2133
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,880
What the fuck does that mean?

2134
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,600
It means that's it for me.

2135
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,680
From here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

2136
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,520
- Jesus Christ.
- Don't blaspheme.

2137
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,280
- God damn it.
- I said don't do that.

2138
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,840
Why are you fucking
freaking out on us?

2139
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,760
Look, I'm telling
Marsellus today.

2140
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:03,840
I'm through.

2141
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,400
Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?

2142
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,640
Don't worry. I will.

2143
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:07,840
VINCENT: Yeah,
and I'll bet you $10,000...

2144
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:08,960
he laughs his ass off.

2145
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,640
I don't give a damn
if he does.

2146
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:14,440
Marvin, what do you make
of all this?

2147
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:16,080
MARVIN: Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

2148
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,680
You got to have an opinion.

2149
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:20,200
Do you think that God came down
from Heaven and stopped...

2150
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:21,320
[Gunshot]

2151
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:24,240
What the fuck's happening?
Oh, shit, man!

2152
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:25,640
VINCENT: Oh, man,
I shot Marvin in the face.

2153
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:26,920
Why the fuck did you do that?

2154
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,320
Well, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

2155
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:31,320
Oh, man, I've seen some
crazy-ass shit in my time...

2156
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,720
Chill out, man.
I told you it was an accident.

2157
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,400
You probably... You went over
a bump or something.

2158
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:36,080
Hey, the car didn't hit
no motherfucking bump.

2159
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:38,560
Hey, look, man, I didn't mean
to shoot the son of a bitch.

2160
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,960
The gun went off.
I don't know why.

2161
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,400
Well, look at
this fucking mess, man!

2162
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,960
We're on a city street
in broad daylight.

2163
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,920
I can't believe it, man.

2164
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:45,120
Well, believe it now,
motherfucker.

2165
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:46,320
We got to get this car
off the road.

2166
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,680
You know,
cops tend to notice shit...

2167
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,720
like you're driving a car
drenched in fucking blood.

2168
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,200
Just take it
to a friendly place, that's all.

2169
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:52,440
This is the Valley, Vincent.

2170
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:53,720
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places.

2171
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,840
Jules, this ain't
my fucking town, man!

2172
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:58,360
- Shit!
- What you doing?

2173
01:51:58,400 --> 01:51:59,680
I'm calling my partner
in Toluca Lake.

2174
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,160
Where's Toluca Lake?

2175
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:03,040
It's just over the hill here,
over by Burbank Studios.

2176
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,680
If Jimmie's ass ain't home...

2177
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,160
I don't know what the fuck
we going to do, man...

2178
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:09,080
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

2179
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,400
Jimmie, yo,
how you doing, man?

2180
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,800
It's Jules.
Just listen up, man.

2181
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,720
Me and my homeboy are in
some serious fucking shit, man.

2182
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:16,600
We're in a car, and we got
to get off the road pronto.

2183
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,680
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

2184
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:21,560
JULES: We got to be
real fucking delicate...

2185
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,000
with this Jimmie situation.

2186
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:25,360
He's one remark away from
kicking our asses out the door.

2187
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,480
VINCENT:
If he does, what do we do?

2188
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:29,040
JULES: We ain't leaving
till we made a couple calls...

2189
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,560
but I don't want it
to reach that pitch.

2190
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:31,600
Jimmie's a friend.

2191
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:32,720
You don't come
into your friend's house...

2192
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:34,160
and start telling him
what's what.

2193
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:36,080
VINCENT: Just tell him not
to be abusive, that's all.

2194
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:39,000
He kind of freaked out
back there when he saw Marvin.

2195
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,160
JULES: Well, put yourself
in his position.

2196
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,360
It's 8:00 in the morning.

2197
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:43,680
He just woke up.
He wasn't expecting this shit.

2198
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:46,480
Shit, we got to remember here
who's doing who a favor.

2199
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,320
VINCENT: If that favor means
that I got to take shit...

2200
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:50,880
then he can stick that favor
straight up his ass.

2201
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:53,400
JULES: Nigger, what the fuck
did you just do to his towel?

2202
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,520
VINCENT:
I was drying my hands.

2203
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:55,760
JULES: You're supposed
to wash them first.

2204
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:56,880
You watched me wash them.

2205
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,320
I watched you get them wet.

2206
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:00,800
I was washing them.
This shit's hard to get off.

2207
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:02,720
Maybe if he had Lava,
I could've done a better job.

2208
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:04,160
I used the same
fucking soap you did...

2209
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:07,080
and the towel didn't look like
no goddamn maxipad.

2210
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:09,520
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

2211
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:11,640
It's shit like this
that'll bring this situation...

2212
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,560
to a head, man.

2213
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,280
Look...

2214
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:18,000
I ain't threatening you
with nothing, all right?

2215
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,840
You know I respect you
and all...

2216
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:22,320
but just don't put me
in this position, all right?

2217
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:25,120
All right. Fine. Fine.

2218
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,880
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

2219
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:30,600
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

2220
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:35,160
JULES: Mmm. Goddamn, Jimmie.

2221
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:37,080
This is some
serious gourmet shit.

2222
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:38,920
JULES: Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

2223
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:41,800
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice, right?

2224
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:45,440
Heh! And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

2225
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:46,520
What flavor is this?

2226
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,800
Knock it off, Julie.

2227
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,120
What?

2228
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:51,880
I don't need you to tell me
how fucking good my coffee is.

2229
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

2230
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,120
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

2231
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,760
I buy the gourmet
expensive stuff...

2232
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,800
because when I drink it,
I want to taste it.

2233
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,400
But you know what's
on my mind right now?

2234
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,600
It ain't the coffee
in my kitchen.

2235
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:05,640
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

2236
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:07,360
Oh, Jimmie,
don't even worry about it.

2237
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,680
I don't think about anything.
I want to ask you a question.

2238
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,120
When you came pulling in here...

2239
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:12,560
did you notice a sign
out in the front of my house...

2240
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,080
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2241
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:15,800
Jimmie, you know
I didn't see no shit...

2242
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,560
Did you notice a sign
in the front of my house...

2243
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:19,360
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2244
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:22,440
No. I didn't.

2245
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:23,760
JIMMIE: You know why
you didn't see that sign?

2246
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:24,920
Why?

2247
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,320
'Cause it ain't there...

2248
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:29,320
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fucking business!

2249
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,720
Jimmie, we're not going
to store the motherfucker.

2250
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:34,040
Don't you fucking realize, man,
that if Bonnie comes home...

2251
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,600
and finds a body in her house,
I'm going to get divorced?

2252
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:38,240
No marriage counselor,
no trial separation.

2253
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,280
I'm going to get
fucking divorced, OK?

2254
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:43,000
And I don't want
to get fucking divorced.

2255
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,560
Now, man, you know, fuck,
I want to help you...

2256
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,840
but I don't want to lose
my wife doing it, all right?

2257
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:49,920
Jimmie, she ain't
going to leave you.

2258
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:51,920
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me,
Jules!

2259
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:54,200
OK?
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me.

2260
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:56,480
There's nothing you're gonna say
that's gonna make me forget...

2261
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,640
that I love my wife, is there?

2262
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,880
Look, you know...

2263
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:05,400
she comes home from work
in about an hour and a half.

2264
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:07,760
Graveyard shift
at the hospital.

2265
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,800
You got to make
some phone calls?

2266
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,440
You got to call some people?

2267
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,680
Well, then do it, and get
the fuck out of my house...

2268
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,520
before she gets here.

2269
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:16,600
That's Kool and the Gang.

2270
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:17,960
We don't want
to fuck your shit up.

2271
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,800
I want to call my people,
get them to bring us in.

2272
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:23,680
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

2273
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:26,480
You'll fuck my shit up big time
if Bonnie comes home.

2274
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:27,960
So just do me that favor,
all right?

2275
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,120
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

2276
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:33,240
Well, say she comes home.

2277
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:36,880
What do you think she'll do?

2278
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:39,280
Oh, no fucking shit,
she'll freak.

2279
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:41,320
That ain't no kind of answer.

2280
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,600
I mean, you know, I don't.

2281
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,360
How much?
A lot or a little?

2282
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:47,480
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

2283
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,120
this Bonnie situation is.

2284
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,320
JULES: I mean, if she comes
home from a hard day's work...

2285
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:52,760
and finds a bunch
of gangsters in her kitchen...

2286
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,720
doing a bunch
of gangster shit...

2287
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:58,080
there ain't no telling
what she's liable to do.

2288
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,880
[Gasps]

2289
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,440
Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules.

2290
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:04,360
All I'm doing
is contemplating the "ifs."

2291
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,640
I don't want to hear about
no motherfucking "ifs."

2292
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:08,040
All I want to hear
from your ass is...

2293
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:10,720
"You ain't got no problem.
I'm on the motherfucker.

2294
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:12,160
"Go back in there,
chill them niggers out...

2295
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,160
"and wait for the cavalry,
which will be coming directly."

2296
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:18,400
MARSELLUS: You ain't
got no problem, Jules.

2297
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:20,480
I'm on the motherfucker.

2298
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:23,000
Go back in there
and chill them niggers out...

2299
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:25,320
and wait for The Wolf,
who should be coming directly.

2300
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,680
You're sending The Wolf?

2301
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,880
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

2302
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:35,200
Shit, negro,
that's all you had to say.

2303
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:38,440
WOLF:
Is she the hysterical type?

2304
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,400
When is she due?

2305
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:43,520
Mm-hmm.

2306
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,400
Give me the principals'
names again.

2307
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,600
Jules.

2308
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:51,640
Mm-hmm.

2309
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:54,400
Vincent.

2310
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:59,760
Jimmie.

2311
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,200
Bonnie.

2312
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:04,200
Mm-hmm.

2313
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:09,560
It's thirty minutes away.

2314
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:11,280
I'll be there in ten.

2315
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:25,720
[Doorbell rings]

2316
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:30,400
You're Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

2317
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:31,360
JIMMIE: Sure is.

2318
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:34,000
I'm Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.

2319
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:35,160
JIMMIE: Good. We got one.

2320
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:36,600
So I heard. May I come in?

2321
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,680
JIMMIE: Yeah, please do.

2322
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:40,640
WOLF: You must be Jules...

2323
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,400
which would make you Vincent.

2324
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:44,320
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

2325
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:45,640
If I was informed correctly...

2326
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:46,600
the clock is ticking,
is that right, Jimmie?

2327
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,480
JIMMIE: 100%

2328
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,160
WOLF: Your wife Bonnie...

2329
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:51,920
comes home at 9:30 in the a.m.,
is that correct?

2330
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:53,240
JIMMIE: Uh-huh.

2331
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,960
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here...

2332
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,680
she wouldn't appreciate it
none too much?

2333
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:59,120
JIMMIE:
She wouldn't at that.

2334
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:01,880
That gives us forty minutes
to get the fuck out of Dodge...

2335
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,960
which, if you do what I say
when I say it, should be plenty.

2336
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,280
Now, you got a corpse
in a car...

2337
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:09,480
minus a head in a garage.
Take me to it.

2338
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:15,600
[Sighs]

2339
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:19,120
- Jimmie?
- Uh-huh.

2340
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,480
Do me a favor, will you?

2341
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,760
I thought I smelled
some coffee back there.

2342
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:24,000
Would you make me a cup?

2343
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:25,560
JIMMIE: Yeah, sure.

2344
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:29,760
JIMMIE:
Oh, how do you take it?

2345
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:32,640
WOLF: Lots of cream,
lots of sugar.

2346
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,200
About the car... is there
anything I need to know?

2347
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:38,480
Does it stall, smoke,
make a lot of noise?

2348
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,080
Is there gas in it?
Anything?

2349
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:42,840
JULES: Aside from how it looks,
the car is cool.

2350
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,720
WOLF: Positive? Don't get me
out there on the road...

2351
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,360
I find out
the brake lights don't work.

2352
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:49,840
JULES: Man, far as I know,
the motherfucker's tiptop.

2353
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:51,720
WOLF: Good enough.

2354
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,560
Let's go back to the kitchen.

2355
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:59,000
[Sighs]

2356
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:00,160
JIMMIE:
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.

2357
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:01,640
WOLF: Thank you, Jimmie.

2358
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:08,120
Mmm.

2359
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,880
WOLF: OK, first thing...

2360
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:13,440
you two, take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

2361
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,160
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

2362
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:17,520
That would lead me to believe
that in the garage...

2363
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,800
or under the sink, you got
a bunch of cleaners and shit?

2364
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:20,840
JIMMIE: Yeah, Mr. Wolf.
Under the sink.

2365
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,760
Good. What I need
you two fellas to do...

2366
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:25,440
is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car.

2367
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,400
I'm talking fast, fast, fast.

2368
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:28,800
Go in the back seat...

2369
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:32,000
scoop up all those little
pieces of brain and skull.

2370
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:33,960
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

2371
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,200
Now, it don't need
to be spick-and-span.

2372
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:39,200
You don't need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once over.

2373
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:41,880
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

2374
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,360
The pools of blood
that have collected...

2375
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,920
you got to soak that shit up.

2376
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:48,000
Now, Jimmie, we need to raid
your linen closet.

2377
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:49,440
I need blankets.
I need comforters.

2378
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:51,360
I need quilts.
I need bedspreads.

2379
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:52,920
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.

2380
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,800
No whites. Can't use 'em.

2381
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,000
We need to camouflage
the interior of the car.

2382
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:58,680
We're going to line
the front seat and back seat...

2383
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:01,520
and the floorboards
with quilts and blankets.

2384
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:04,120
So if a cop stops us and sticks
his big snout in the car...

2385
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:05,720
the subterfuge won't last...

2386
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:08,520
but at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.

2387
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,520
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

2388
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:13,560
VINCENT:
"Please" would be nice.

2389
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:14,520
WOLF: Come again?

2390
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,520
I said
a "please" would be nice.

2391
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,480
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say "please."

2392
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,720
I'm here to tell you what to do.

2393
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:25,480
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess...

2394
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:28,800
you better fucking do it
and do it quick.

2395
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:30,080
I'm here to help.

2396
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:32,760
If my help is not appreciated,
lots of luck, gentlemen.

2397
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,240
JULES: No, Mr. Wolf,
it ain't like that.

2398
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:35,320
Your help is definitely
appreciated.

2399
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,960
VINCENT: Mr. Wolf, listen.

2400
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,360
I don't mean disrespect, OK?
I respect you.

2401
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,640
I don't like people barking
orders at me, that's all.

2402
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:44,440
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

2403
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:46,320
I think fast, I talk fast...

2404
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:49,360
and I need you guys to act fast
if you want out of this...

2405
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:51,200
so pretty please
with sugar on top...

2406
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:53,160
clean the fucking car.

2407
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:58,440
Don't be looking at me
like that, all right?

2408
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,880
I can feel your look.

2409
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:05,280
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

2410
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:08,920
Green.

2411
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:13,840
Nothing except
for the mess inside.

2412
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,080
Mmm, about twenty minutes.

2413
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:21,680
Nobody who'll be missed.

2414
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:27,000
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

2415
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,440
How we coming, Jimmie?

2416
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:30,520
JIMMIE: Pretty good.
I got it all here...

2417
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,680
but, uh...

2418
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:33,800
Mr. Wolf, you got to
understand something.

2419
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,840
Winston, Jimmie, please.
Winston.

2420
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:39,360
JIMMIE: You got to understand
something now, Winston.

2421
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:41,200
Uh, no, thank you.

2422
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:44,320
This is our best linen here...

2423
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:46,880
and it was a wedding present...

2424
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:48,520
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny...

2425
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:49,840
and they're not with us anymore.

2426
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:51,280
I really want
to help you guys out...

2427
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:53,800
WOLF: Let me ask you
a question, Jimmie...

2428
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:54,760
if you don't mind.

2429
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:58,200
JIMMIE:
No, please, go ahead.

2430
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:01,520
WOLF: Your Uncle Conrad
and Aunt Ginny...

2431
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:03,720
were they millionaires?

2432
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,400
JIMMIE: No.

2433
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:08,200
WOLF: Well,
your Uncle Marsellus is...

2434
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:11,480
and I'm positive
if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

2435
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:14,040
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here...

2436
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:18,280
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set...

2437
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:22,160
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

2438
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:26,280
I like oak myself.

2439
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:29,840
That's what I have
in my bedroom.

2440
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:32,920
How about you, Jimmie?

2441
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,880
You an oak man?

2442
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,240
Oak's nice.

2443
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:44,800
JULES: Oh, man.

2444
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,040
I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.

2445
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:48,760
This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit.

2446
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:50,520
Jules, did you ever hear
the philosophy...

2447
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,320
that once a man admits
that he is wrong...

2448
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:55,360
that he is immediately
forgiven for all wrongdoings?

2449
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:57,520
JULES: Get the fuck out my face
with that shit.

2450
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:59,520
The motherfucker said that shit
never had to pick up...

2451
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:01,800
itty-bitty pieces of skull
on account of your dumb ass.

2452
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,160
VINCENT:
I got a threshold, Jules.

2453
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:05,120
I got a threshold
for the abuse that I will take.

2454
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:06,760
Right now, I'm a fucking
race car, all right?

2455
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,040
And you got me in the red.

2456
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:10,520
I'm just saying
that it's fucking dangerous...

2457
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,480
to have a race car
in the fucking red, that's all.

2458
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:14,320
- I could blow.
- Oh, you ready to blow?

2459
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:15,840
Yeah, I'm ready to blow.

2460
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:18,840
I'm a mushroom cloud-laying
motherfucker, motherfucker.

2461
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:21,400
Every time my fingers touch
brain, I'm "Superfly TNT."

2462
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,640
I'm "The Guns of the Navarone."

2463
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:25,840
In fact, what the fuck
am I doing in the back?

2464
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:28,200
You the motherfucker
who should be on brain detail.

2465
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:30,120
We fucking switching.
I'm washing the windows...

2466
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:31,800
and you picking up
this nigger's skull.

2467
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:43,040
WOLF: Fine job, gentlemen.

2468
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:46,240
We may get out of this yet.

2469
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,800
JIMMIE: I can't believe
this is the same car.

2470
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:52,320
WOLF: Let's not start sucking
each other's dicks quite yet.

2471
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:53,760
Phase one is complete...
clean the car...

2472
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,520
which moves us right
along to phase two...

2473
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:57,000
clean you two.

2474
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:01,000
Strip.

2475
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:02,520
All the way?

2476
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,680
WOLF: To your bare ass.

2477
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:06,280
Quickly, gentlemen.

2478
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,800
WOLF:
We got about fifteen minutes...

2479
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:10,800
before Jimmie's better half
pulls into the driveway.

2480
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:13,080
Damn. This morning air
is some chilly shit.

2481
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:15,000
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

2482
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,440
You know what you two
look like?

2483
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:17,920
VINCENT: What?

2484
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:19,680
Like a couple of guys who just
blew off somebody's head.

2485
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:24,080
Stripping off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

2486
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:30,080
Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.

2487
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,600
JULES:
Don't do nothing stupid...

2488
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:33,760
like leaving this shit out front
for Otto the Garbageman...

2489
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:34,760
you know what I'm saying?

2490
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:36,640
Don't worry.
We're taking it with us.

2491
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:39,000
Jim, the soap.

2492
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:42,240
- Vincent.
- OK, gentlemen...

2493
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:44,640
you've both been
to County before I'm sure.

2494
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:45,640
Here it comes.

2495
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:48,120
Goddamn!
The water's fucking cold.

2496
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:49,880
WOLF: Better you
than me, gentlemen.

2497
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:52,080
Ha ha ha!

2498
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:53,600
Don't be afraid
of the soap.

2499
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:54,560
Spread it around.

2500
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:55,480
Get him up there
a little bit.

2501
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:57,600
JIMMIE: Vincent's hair.

2502
02:04:57,640 --> 02:04:59,320
JULES: Come on, do it,
God damn it! Do it!

2503
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:01,360
Uh, uh...

2504
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:02,840
Towel 'em.

2505
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:16,440
WOLF: They're dry enough.
Toss them their clothes.

2506
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:18,240
[Wolf laughs]

2507
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:19,480
Perfect.

2508
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:22,960
Perfect. We couldn't
have planned this better.

2509
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,240
You guys look like...

2510
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,360
What do they look like, Jimmie?

2511
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,400
Dorks.

2512
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:29,480
[Laughs]

2513
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:30,560
They look like
a couple of dorks.

[Both laugh]

2515
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:34,080
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

2516
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:35,240
Come on, gentlemen.

2517
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,800
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

2518
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:38,720
Don't make me beg.

2519
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:44,960
OK, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

2520
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,360
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

2521
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:49,880
Now, Monster Joe
and his daughter Raquel...

2522
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:51,320
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

2523
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:53,360
The place is North Hollywood...

2524
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:57,040
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be going up Hollywood Way.

2525
02:05:57,080 --> 02:06:00,400
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

2526
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:03,560
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

2527
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:07,600
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws...

2528
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:09,400
nobody does a fucking thing
till I do something.

2529
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:10,480
- Right.
- What did I say?

2530
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:13,240
Don't do shit unless...

2531
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:15,560
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

2532
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:17,920
Spoken like a true prodigy.

2533
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:19,040
How about you, Lash La Rue?

2534
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:21,480
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

2535
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:22,960
Mr. Wolf, look,
the gun went off.

2536
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,160
I don't why.

2537
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:25,320
I'm cool. I promise you.

2538
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:28,720
Fair enough. Now, I drive
real fucking fast, so keep up.

2539
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:30,880
If I get my car back
any different than I gave it...

2540
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:33,560
Monster Joe's going to be
disposing of two bodies.

[Metal clatters]

2542
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:38,880
Out of my way, Rex.

2543
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:42,920
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

2544
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:43,960
VINCENT: All right.

2545
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,520
WOLF: Boys, this is Raquel.

2546
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:49,320
Someday, all this will be hers.

2547
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,800
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

2548
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:54,360
RAQUEL: You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?

[Wolf laughs]

2550
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:58,360
I'm taking my lady
out for breakfast.

2551
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,280
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

2552
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:01,640
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

2553
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:04,040
It's... it's your future.

2554

I... I see a... a cab ride.

Move out of the sticks, fellas.

Good night, Raquel.

I'll see you guys around.

Stay out of trouble,
you crazy kids.

2560
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:17,200
Mr. Wolf,
I just want to tell you...

2561
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:19,120
it was a real pleasure
watching you work.

2562
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:23,040
Yeah, really, and thank you
very much, Mr. Wolf.

[Car alarm chirps]

2566
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:31,280
Respect for one's elders
shows character.

2567
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:33,280
I have character.

2568
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:35,000

02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:00,920
PUMPKIN: That's it.
Get the fuck down.

2741
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,920
In the bag.

2742
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:03,200
In the fucking bag!

2743
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:06,200
CUSTOMER: I don't have
nothing on me, man.

2744
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:09,320
PUMPKIN: What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

2745
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:11,760
Laura? Laura, tips.

2746
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:13,240
- In the bag.
- Yeah.

2747
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:14,960
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

2748
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,920
In the fucking bag.

2749
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:19,320
Tidy up, tidy up.
That's it.

2750
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:21,240
Now get the fuck
down on the floor.

2751
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:22,880
In the bag.

2752
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,360
In the bag.

2753
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:37,120
In the bag.

2754
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:52,840
What's in the case?

2755
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,400
My boss's dirty laundry.

2756
02:14:54,440 --> 02:14:55,840
Your boss makes you
do his laundry?

2757
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:56,840
JULES:
When he wants it clean.

2758
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:57,880
Sounds like a shit job.

2759
02:14:57,920 --> 02:14:59,560
Funny.
I was thinking the same thing.

2760
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,600
Open it.

2761
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:02,480
Afraid I can't do that.

2762
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:05,280
I didn't hear you.

2763
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:06,680
Yes, you did.

2764
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:08,960
HONEYBUNNY:
What's going on?

2765
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,840
PUMPKIN: Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.

2766
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:13,440
HONEYBUNNY:
Shoot him in the face.

2767
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:15,480
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time...

2768
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:16,960
I've had a gun pointed at me.

2769
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,360
You don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.

2770
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:21,440
MANAGER: Stop causing problems!
You'll get us all killed!

2771
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:23,040
Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of there!

2772
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:24,320
Shut the fuck up, fat man!

2773
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:25,600
This ain't none
of your goddamn business.

2774
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:29,520
Be cool, Honey Bunny. Be cool.

2775
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:31,480
It's no problem.
I got it under control.

2776
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:34,920
Now I'm going to count to three.

2777
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:38,200
If you don't open that case...

2778
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:42,240
I'm going to unload
in your fucking face.

2779
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,880
We clear?

2780
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:50,200
One...

2781
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:54,920
two...

2782
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:57,400
- three.
- OK, Ringo.

2783
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,640
You win.

2784
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:01,120
It's yours.

2785
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:07,880
Open it.

2786
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:13,720
HONEYBUNNY:
What is it?

2787
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:16,000
What is it?

2788
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:18,560
Is that what I think it is?

2789
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:20,280
Mm-hmm.

2790
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,360
It's beautiful.

2791
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:27,320
HONEYBUNNY:
God damn it, what is it?

2792
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:32,520
You let him go! You let him go!
Let go of him!

2793
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:34,440
- Tell that bitch to be cool!
- I'm gonna kill you!

2794
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:36,200
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2795
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:37,680
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool!

2796
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:39,000
Tell that fuckin' bitch
to chill!

2797
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:40,480
PUMPKIN:
Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2798
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:42,880
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2799
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:44,640
- Let go of him!
- JULES: Chill!

2800
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:45,800
Tell her it's
going to be all right.

2801
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:46,800
It's going to be all right.

2802
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:48,080
- Promise her!
- I promise!

2803
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:49,800
- Tell her to chill!
- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!

2804
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:51,240
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2805
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:52,920
All right, now, Yolanda!

2806
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:54,880
JULES: We're not gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

2807
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:56,280
Don't you hurt him!

2808
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:57,480
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.

2809
02:16:57,520 --> 02:16:59,880
We're all gonna be like
three little Fonzies here.

2810
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:01,760
And what's Fonzie like?

2811
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:04,000
JULES: Come on, Yolanda,
what's Fonzie like?!

2812
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,080
He's cool?

2813
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,480
- JULES: What?
- Cool.

2814
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:07,800
Correctamundo!

2815
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:11,200
And that's what we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.

2816
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:16,040
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2817
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:17,960
And when I count three...

2818
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,240
I want you to let go
of your gun...

2819
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:22,680
put your palms
flat on the table...

2820
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:25,280
and sit your ass down.

2821
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:29,440
But when you do it,
you do it cool.

2822
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:30,600
You ready?

2823
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:33,880
One...

2824
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:35,960
two...

2825
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:37,280
three.

2826
02:17:44,520 --> 02:17:46,880
OK, now you let him go!

2827
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:49,040
JULES: Yolanda, I thought
you were gonna be cool.

2828
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:51,080
Now, when you yell at me,
it makes me nervous.

2829
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:53,160
JULES: And when I get nervous,
I get scared.

2830
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:55,000
And when motherfuckers
get scared...

2831
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:58,520
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2832
02:17:58,560 --> 02:18:01,960
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

2833
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,440
Well, that seems
to be the situation.

2834
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:09,120
But I don't want that,
and you don't want that...

2835
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:11,960
and Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2836
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,880
So let's see what we can do.

2837
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:16,120
JULES: Now...

2838
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:19,720
here's the situation.

2839
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:21,080
Normally both your asses...

2840
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,040
would be dead
as fuckin' fried chicken...

2841
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:24,280
but you happened
to pull this shit...

2842
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:25,600
while I'm in
a transitional period...

2843
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:28,320
and I don't want to kill you.
I want to help you.

2844
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:32,840
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2845
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:36,040
Besides, I been through
too much shit over this case...

2846
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:39,200
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2847
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:40,760
Vincent!

2848
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:42,320
Be cool!

2849
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:45,240
Yolanda, it's cool, baby!
It's cool!

2850
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:46,440
We still just talking!

2851
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:48,040
Come on, point the gun at me!

2852
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:49,920
Point the gun at me!
There you go.

2853
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:54,400
Now, Vincent, you just hang back
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2854
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:57,080
Tell her we're still cool.

2855
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,520
We're still cool, Honey Bunny.

2856
02:18:58,560 --> 02:19:00,520
How we doing, baby?

2857
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:03,680
I... I gotta go pee.
I want to go home.

2858
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:05,200
JULES:
Just hang in there, baby.

2859
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:06,720
You're doin' great.
I'm proud of you.

2860
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:07,960
And Ringo's proud of you.

2861
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,720
It's almost over.

2862
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:11,640
Tell her you're proud of her.

2863
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:12,920
I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.

2864
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:14,680
I love you.

2865
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:16,320
I love you, too, Honey Bunny.

2866
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:21,240
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2867
02:19:23,720 --> 02:19:25,120
Which one is it?

2868
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:27,400
It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

2869
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:43,080
JULES: That's it.

2870
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:44,520
That's my Bad Motherfucker.

2871
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:47,000
Open it up. Take out the money.

2872
02:19:52,480 --> 02:19:53,960
JULES: Count it.

2873
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,440
How much is there?

2874
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:06,080
About $1,500.

2875
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:09,240
OK, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2876
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:12,080
With the rest of those wallets
and the register...

2877
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:13,960
that makes this a pretty
successful little score.

2878
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,480
VINCENT: Jules, you give
that fuckin' nimrod $1,500...

2879
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:18,240
and I'll shoot him
on general principle.

2880
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:19,320
No, Yolanda, Yolanda!

2881
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:21,400
He ain't gonna do a goddamn
motherfuckin' thing.

2882
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:23,040
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2883
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:24,600
Shut up!

2884
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:26,520
Come on, Yolanda,
stay with me, baby.

2885
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:30,520
Now, I ain't givin' it to him,
Vincent.

2886
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:32,280
I'm buyin' somethin'
for my money.

2887
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:35,680
Wanna know what I'm buyin',
Ringo?

2888
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:36,760
What?

2889
02:20:36,840 --> 02:20:37,920
Your life.

2890
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:39,520
I'm givin' you that money...

2891
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:42,280
so I don't have
to kill your ass.

2892
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:45,040
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2893
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:46,680
Not regularly, no.

2894
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:49,040
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2895
02:20:49,080 --> 02:20:52,600
"Ezekiel" 25:17.

2896
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:55,640
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2897
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,400
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

2898
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:59,160
"and the tyranny of evil men.

2899
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:02,600
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will...

2900
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:04,880
"shepherds the weak through
the Valley of Darkness...

2901
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:06,360
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

2902
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:08,920
"and the finder
of lost children.

2903
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:10,840
"And I will strike down
upon thee...

2904
02:21:10,880 --> 02:21:13,120
"with great vengeance
and furious anger...

2905
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:16,040
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2906
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:19,000
"and you will know
I am the Lord...

2907
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:22,520
"when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2908
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:25,720
Now, I been sayin'
that shit for years.

2909
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:30,040
And if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2910
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:31,840
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2911
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:33,440
I just thought
it was some cold-blooded shit...

2912
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:36,960
to say to a motherfucker before
I popped a cap in his ass.

2913
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:40,520
But I saw some shit this mornin'
made me think twice.

2914
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,600
See, now I'm thinkin'...

2915
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:46,200
maybe it means
you're the evil man...

2916
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:48,120
and I'm the righteous man...

2917
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:50,160
and Mr. Nine-millimeter here...

2918
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:52,040
he's the shepherd
protecting my righteous ass...

2919
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:54,560
in the Valley of Darkness.

2920
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:56,480
Or it could mean...

2921
02:21:56,480 --> 02:21:59,600
you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd...

2922
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:03,680
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2923
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:05,920
Now, I'd like that.

2924
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:08,720
But that shit ain't the truth.

2925
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:10,440
The truth is...

2926
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:14,680
you're the weak...

2927
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:18,000
and I am the tyranny
of evil men.

2928
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:22,080
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2929
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:27,480
I'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd.

2930
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:43,440
JULES: Go on.

2931
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:01,360
[Sighs]

2932
02:23:01,400 --> 02:23:03,960
I think we should
be leaving now.

2933
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,960
Yeah,
that's probably a good idea.
