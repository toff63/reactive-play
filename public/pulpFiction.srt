<p>I'm through doing that shit.</p>

<p>the same thing every time.</p>

<p>too dangerous."</p>

<p>I know that's what I always say.</p>

<p>But you forget about it</p>
<p>in a day or two.</p>

<p>forgetting are over...</p>

<p>and the days of me remembering</p>
<p>have just begun.</p>

<p>You know when you go on</p>
<p>like this what you sound like?</p>

<p>I sound like</p>
<p>a sensible fucking man.</p>

<p>You sound like a duck.</p>

<p>gonna have to hear it again...</p>

<p>since I'm never</p>
<p>gonna do it again...</p>

<p>you're never gonna</p>
<p>have to hear me quack...</p>

<p>about how I'm never</p>
<p>gonna do it again.</p>

<p>After tonight.</p>

<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I got all tonight to quack.</p>

<p>Can I get anyone more coffee?</p>

<p>HONEYBUNNY:</p>

<p>You're welcome.</p>


<p>you're taking the same risk</p>
<p>as when you rob a bank.</p>

<p>You take more of a risk.</p>
<p>Banks are easier.</p>

<p>Federal banks</p>
<p>ain't supposed to stop you...</p>

<p>in any way during a robbery.</p>

<p>They're insured.</p>
<p>Why should they give a fuck?</p>

<p>You don't even need a gun</p>
<p>in a federal bank.</p>

<p>PUMPKIN: I heard about</p>
<p>this one bloke...</p>

<p>He walks into a bank</p>
<p>with a portable phone.</p>

<p>He gives the phone</p>
<p>to the teller...</p>

<p>bloke on the other end</p>
<p>of the phone says...</p>

<p>"We got this guy's little girl.</p>

<p>"If you don't give him</p>
<p>all your money...</p>

<p>- "we're gonna kill her."</p>
<p>- Did it work?</p>

<p>That's what I'm talking about!</p>

<p>Knucklehead walks into a bank</p>
<p>with a telephone...</p>


<p>a fucking phone.</p>
<p>Cleans the place out.</p>

<p>They don't even lift</p>
<p>a fucking finger.</p>

<p>Did they hurt the little girl?</p>

<p>I don't know. Probably never was</p>
<p>a girl in the first place.</p>

<p>The point isn't the girl.</p>
<p>The point is...</p>

<p>they robbed a bank</p>
<p>with a telephone.</p>

<p>You want to rob banks?</p>

<p>I'm not saying</p>
<p>I want to rob banks.</p>

<p>than what we been doing.</p>

<p>No more liquor stores?</p>

<p>What we been talking about?</p>

<p>it used to be.</p>

<p>There's too many foreigners</p>
<p>own liquor stores.</p>

<p>even speak fucking English.</p>

<p>"Empty out the register..."</p>

<p>they don't know what the fuck</p>
<p>you're talking about.</p>

<p>They make it too personal.</p>

<p>fucker's gonna make us kill him.</p>

<p>I'm not gonna kill anybody.</p>

<p>either.</p>

<p>But they'll probably</p>
<p>put us in a situation...</p>

<p>where it's us or them.</p>

<p>it's these old fucking Jews...</p>

<p>who've owned the store</p>
<p>for fifteen fucking generations.</p>

<p>You got Grandpa Irving</p>
<p>sitting behind the counter...</p>

<p>with a fucking Magnum</p>
<p>in his hand.</p>

<p>Try walking into one of those</p>
<p>places with nothing but a phone.</p>

<p>See how far that gets you.</p>
<p>Fuck it. We're out of it.</p>

<p>Day jobs?</p>

<p>- Not in this life.</p>

<p>Garcon! Coffee!</p>

<p>This place.</p>

<p>WAITRESS: Garcon means "boy."</p>

<p>This place? A coffee shop?</p>

<p>What's wrong with that?</p>

<p>Nobody ever robs restaurants.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>

<p>gas stations...</p>

<p>you get your head blown off</p>
<p>sticking up one of them.</p>

<p>you catch with their pants down.</p>

<p>They're not expecting</p>
<p>to get robbed.</p>


<p>HONEYBUNNY: I bet you could</p>
<p>cut down on the hero factor...</p>

<p>in a place like this.</p>

<p>PUMPKIN: Correct.</p>

<p>these places are insured.</p>

<p>Manager... he don't give a fuck.</p>

<p>He's just trying</p>
<p>to get you out the door...</p>

<p>before you start</p>
<p>plugging the diners.</p>

<p>Waitresses? Fucking forget it.</p>

<p>No way they're taking a bullet</p>
<p>for the register.</p>


<p>really give a fuck</p>
<p>you're stealing from the owner?</p>

<p>PUMPKIN: Customers sitting</p>
<p>with food in their mouths.</p>

<p>They don't know</p>
<p>what's going on.</p>

<p>One minute they're</p>
<p>having a Denver omelet...</p>

<p>sticking a gun in their face.</p>


<p>last liquor store we stuck up.</p>
<p>Remember?</p>

<p>All the customers</p>
<p>kept coming in?</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>You got the idea</p>
<p>taking their wallets.</p>

<p>- HONEYBUNNY: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Made more from the wallets</p>
<p>than we did from the register.</p>

<p>- People come to restaurants.</p>

<p>A lot of wallets.</p>


<p>Pretty smart.</p>

<p>I'm ready. Let's do it.</p>

<p>- HONEYBUNNY: Come on.</p>
<p>- All right.</p>


<p>You're crowd control.</p>
<p>I handle employees.</p>



<p>This is a robbery!</p>

<p>HONEYBUNNY: Any of you</p>
<p>fucking pricks move...</p>

<p>and I'll execute every</p>

<p>the metric system there.</p>

<p>They wouldn't know what the fuck</p>
<p>a Quarter-Pounder is.</p>

<p>What do they call it?</p>

<p>VINCENT: They call it</p>
<p>a "Royale with Cheese."</p>

<p>- "Royale with Cheese."</p>

<p>What do they call a Big Mac?</p>

<p>"Le Big Mac." Ha ha ha ha.</p>

<p>- Goddamn!</p>

<p>Ha ha ha.</p>

<p>They fucking drown 'em</p>

<p>Yuck.</p>

<p>We should have shotguns</p>
<p>for this kind of deal.</p>

<p>- How many up there?</p>
<p>- Three or four.</p>

<p>That's counting our guy?</p>

<p>I'm not sure.</p>

<p>So that means it could be</p>

<p>It's possible.</p>

<p>We should have fucking shotguns.</p>

<p>- VINCENT: What's her name?</p>
<p>- JULES: Mia.</p>

<p>Mia. How did Marsellus</p>
<p>and her meet?</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>However people meet people.</p>

<p>She used to be an actress.</p>

<p>I'd have seen?</p>

<p>I think her biggest deal</p>
<p>was she starred in a pilot.</p>

<p>Pilot? What's a pilot?</p>


<p>I don't watch TV.</p>


<p>that there's an invention</p>
<p>called television...</p>

<p>and on this invention</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>they make one show.</p>

<p>That show's called a pilot.</p>

<p>Then they show that one show</p>
<p>to the people who pick shows...</p>

<p>and on the strength</p>
<p>of that one show...</p>

<p>they decide if they want</p>
<p>to make more shows.</p>

<p>Some get chosen</p>
<p>and become television programs.</p>


<p>She starred in one of the ones</p>
<p>that became nothing.</p>

<p>You remember Antwan Rockamora?</p>

<p>used to call him</p>
<p>"Tony Rocky Horror"?</p>


<p>I wouldn't go so far</p>
<p>as to call the brother fat.</p>


<p>he's Samoan.</p>

<p>who you mean. What about him?</p>

<p>Marsellus fucked him up good.</p>

<p>Word around the campfire is...</p>

<p>it was on account</p>
<p>of Marsellus Wallace's wife.</p>

<p>[Elevator dings]</p>

<p>[Elevator motor engages]</p>


<p>Nothing that bad.</p>


<p>Gave her a foot massage.</p>

<p>- A foot massage? That's it?</p>
<p>- Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Then what did Marsellus do?</p>

<p>Sent a couple of cats</p>
<p>over to his place.</p>

<p>threw his ass over the balcony.</p>

<p>Nigger fell four stories.</p>

<p>They had a little garden</p>
<p>down at the bottom...</p>

<p>like a greenhouse.</p>

<p>Nigger fell through that.</p>

<p>developed a speech impediment.</p>

<p>That's a damn shame.</p>

<p>you get burned.</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p>You don't be giving</p>
<p>Marsellus Wallace's new bride...</p>

<p>a foot massage.</p>

<p>You don't think he overreacted?</p>

<p>didn't expect Marsellus...</p>

<p>but he had to expect a reaction.</p>

<p>It was a foot massage.</p>
<p>A foot massage is nothing.</p>

<p>I give my mother a foot massage.</p>

<p>in a familiar way...</p>

<p>on Marsellus' new wife.</p>

<p>as eating her pussy out?</p>

<p>the same fucking ballpark.</p>

<p>stop right there.</p>

<p>Eating a bitch out and giving</p>
<p>a bitch a foot massage...</p>

<p>ain't even</p>
<p>the same fucking thing.</p>

<p>It's not.</p>
<p>It's the same ballpark.</p>

<p>neither.</p>

<p>of massage differs from mine...</p>

<p>but you know</p>
<p>touching his wife's feet...</p>

<p>and sticking your tongue</p>
<p>in her holiest of holies...</p>

<p>ain't the same fucking ballpark.</p>
<p>It ain't the same league.</p>

<p>It ain't even</p>
<p>the same fucking sport.</p>

<p>foot massages don't mean shit.</p>

<p>Have you ever given</p>
<p>a foot massage?</p>

<p>[Chuckles] Don't be telling me</p>
<p>about foot massages.</p>

<p>Got my technique down</p>
<p>and everything.</p>

<p>I don't be tickling or nothing.</p>

<p>Would you give a guy</p>
<p>a foot massage?</p>

<p>Fuck you.</p>

<p>[Radio plays indistinctly]</p>

<p>- You given 'em a lot?</p>

<p>I could use</p>

<p>I'm getting</p>
<p>a little pissed here.</p>

<p>- This is the door.</p>
<p>- There it is.</p>

<p>What time you got?</p>


<p>Come on. Let's hang back.</p>

<p>Just 'cause I wouldn't give</p>
<p>no man a foot massage...</p>

<p>don't make it right</p>
<p>for Marsellus...</p>

<p>to throw Antwan</p>
<p>off a building...</p>

<p>into a glass</p>
<p>motherfucking house...</p>

<p>fucking up the way the nigger</p>
<p>talks. That shit ain't right.</p>

<p>he better paralyze my ass...</p>

<p>'cause I'd kill</p>
<p>the motherfucker...</p>

<p>- you know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>- I ain't saying it's right.</p>

<p>But you're saying a foot massage</p>
<p>don't mean nothing...</p>

<p>and I'm saying it does.</p>

<p>I've given a million ladies</p>
<p>a million foot massages...</p>

<p>and they all meant something.</p>

<p>but they do.</p>

<p>That's what's so fucking cool</p>
<p>about 'em.</p>

<p>There's a sensuous thing</p>


<p>Fucking Marsellus knew it...</p>

<p>and Antwan should've fucking</p>
<p>better known better.</p>


<p>This ain't a man with a sense</p>
<p>of humor about this shit.</p>

<p>You know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>It's an interesting point.</p>

<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Let's get into character.</p>

<p>- Mia.</p>
<p>- Mia.</p>

<p>Why you so interested</p>
<p>in big man's wife?</p>

<p>Florida...</p>

<p>and he asked me if I'd take care</p>
<p>of her while he's gone.</p>

<p>- Take care of her?</p>

<p>Make sure she don't get lonely.</p>

<p>You're gonna be taking</p>
<p>Mia Wallace out on a date?</p>

<p>It is not a date.</p>

<p>It's just like if you were going</p>
<p>to take your buddy's wife...</p>

<p>to a movie or something.</p>

<p>that's all.</p>

<p>[Jules sighs]</p>

<p>It's not a date.</p>

<p>Big Kahuna Burger. That's</p>

<p>a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese</p>

<p>- No.</p>

<p>- No!</p>

<p>Then why you try to fuck him</p>

<p>- I didn't.</p>

<p>'Cause a year from now...</p>

<p>when you're kickin' it</p>
<p>in the Caribbean...</p>

<p>"Marsellus Wallace was right."</p>

<p>MARSELLUS: Ha ha ha.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace.</p>

<p>your ass goes down.</p>

<p>MARSELLUS: Say it.</p>


<p>our man in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>our man in Inglewood.</p>

<p>Get your asses on in here!</p>

<p>What's up with them clothes?</p>

<p>JULES:</p>
<p>You don't even want to know.</p>

<p>Where's the big man?</p>

<p>Big man's right over there</p>
<p>taking care of some business.</p>

<p>Why don't you hang back</p>

<p>just go on over.</p>

<p>[Paul sighs]</p>

<p>VINCENT: How you been?</p>

<p>I've been doing pretty good.</p>
<p>How 'bout yourself?</p>

<p>All right. [Sniffs]</p>

<p>tomorrow?</p>

<p>At Marsellus' request.</p>

<p>Have you met Mia?</p>

<p>- Not yet.</p>
<p>- [Laughing]</p>

<p>- What's so fucking funny?</p>
<p>- Not a goddamn thing.</p>

<p>[Chuckling]</p>
<p>I got to piss.</p>

<p>all right?</p>

<p>It's the big man's wife.</p>
<p>I'm gonna sit across from her...</p>

<p>chew my food</p>
<p>with my mouth closed...</p>

<p>and that's it.</p>

<p>and this shit's between y'all.</p>

<p>Then what did you fucking ask me</p>
<p>about it for?</p>

<p>[Quietly] Asshole.</p>

<p>[Sighs]</p>

<p>Give me a pack of Red Apples.</p>

<p>- PAUL: Filters?</p>
<p>- Nah.</p>

<p>friend?</p>


<p>What was that?</p>

<p>punchy.</p>

<p>MARSELLUS:</p>
<p>Vincent Vega's in the house?</p>

<p>My nigger.</p>
<p>Get your ass over here.</p>

<p>AL GREEN SINGING:</p>
<p>You'd never do that to me</p>

<p>- What's up?</p>
<p>- I'm sorry.</p>

<p>MARSELLUS:</p>
<p>Don't worry about it.</p>

<p>PAUL: Pack of Red Apples.</p>

<p>And some matches.</p>

<p>AL GREEN SINGING:</p>
<p>Here's what I want to do</p>

<p>Hey</p>

<p>We ought to stay together</p>

<p>WOMAN: It's as if it turns...</p>

<p>every part of your body</p>
<p>into the tip of a penis.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I'll lend it to you.</p>
<p>It's a great book on piercing.</p>

<p>how they use that gun...</p>

<p>to pierce your ears?</p>

<p>They don't use that to pierce</p>

<p>Forget that gun.</p>

<p>That gun goes against</p>
<p>the entire idea behind piercing.</p>

<p>eighteen places on my body...</p>

<p>every one of 'em</p>
<p>done with a needle.</p>

<p>Five in each ear. One through</p>
<p>the nipple of my left breast.</p>

<p>WOMAN: Two in my right nostril.</p>
<p>One in my left eyebrow.</p>

<p>One in my belly. One in my lip.</p>
<p>One in my clit.</p>

<p>And I wear a stud in my tongue.</p>

<p>VINCENT: Excuse me.</p>


<p>why would you wear a stud</p>
<p>in your tongue?</p>

<p>It's a sex thing.</p>
<p>Helps fellatio.</p>

<p>Vincenzo. Step into my office.</p>

<p>[Door closes]</p>

<p>from Mexico.</p>

<p>Very good stuff.</p>


<p>the Hartz Mountains of Germany.</p>

<p>are the same...</p>

<p>Those are friend prices.</p>

<p>But this one</p>
<p>is a little more expensive.</p>

<p>but when you shoot it...</p>

<p>you will know</p>
<p>where that extra money went.</p>

<p>with these two.</p>

<p>real good shit.</p>

<p>But this one</p>
<p>is a fucking madman.</p>

<p>I just got back from Amsterdam.</p>

<p>[Chuckles] Am I a nigger?</p>

<p>Are we in Inglewood?</p>
<p>No. You're in my home.</p>

<p>who know the difference...</p>

<p>this is the house they come to.</p>

<p>I'll take the Pepsi Challenge...</p>

<p>with that Amsterdam shit</p>
<p>any old day of the fucking week.</p>

<p>That's a bold statement.</p>

<p>[Chuckles]</p>

<p>This is a seller's market.</p>

<p>Coke is fucking dead as... dead.</p>

<p>Heroin is coming back</p>
<p>in a big fucking way.</p>

<p>give me three grams of madman.</p>

<p>If it's as good</p>
<p>as you say it is...</p>

<p>I'll come back</p>
<p>and buy another thousand.</p>

<p>have some left for you.</p>

<p>But... I'm giving you some</p>
<p>out of my own private stash.</p>

<p>That is what a nice guy I am.</p>

<p>Is a baggie all right?</p>


<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'll just get one for you.</p>

<p>will you get me some baggies...</p>

<p>twistix from the kitchen?</p>

<p>WOMAN: OK.</p>

<p>what do you think about Trudi?</p>

<p>She ain't got a boyfriend.</p>


<p>Which one is Trudi?</p>

<p>The one with all the shit</p>
<p>in her face.</p>


<p>[Laughing together]</p>

<p>- Thank you.</p>


<p>All right. No problemo.</p>

<p>- I'll take a rain check.</p>
<p>- [Knock on door]</p>

<p>- VINCENT: Oh.</p>

<p>LANCE: Still got your Malibu?</p>

<p>fucker did the other day?</p>

<p>- LANCE: What?</p>
<p>- Fucking keyed it.</p>

<p>- VINCENT: Tell me about it.</p>


<p>and some dickless piece of shit</p>
<p>fucked with it.</p>

<p>LANCE: They should be</p>

<p>straight to execution.</p>

<p>I could've caught him doing it.</p>

<p>I'd have given anything</p>
<p>to catch that asshole doing it.</p>

<p>VINCENT: It'a been worth him</p>
<p>doing it...</p>

<p>just so I could've caught him</p>
<p>doing it.</p>

<p>- What a fucker!</p>
<p>- What's more chicken shit...</p>

<p>than fucking</p>
<p>with a man's automobile?</p>

<p>with another man's vehicle.</p>

<p>- You don't do it.</p>
<p>- It's just against the rules.</p>

<p>- Thank you.</p>
<p>- Thank you.</p>

<p>Mind if I shoot up here?</p>

<p>Hello?</p>

<p>DUSTY SPRINGFIELD SINGING:</p>
<p>Billy Ray was a preacher's son</p>

<p>And when his daddy</p>
<p>would visit he'd come along</p>

<p>Vincent.</p>

<p>MIA ON INTERCOM: Vincent.</p>
<p>I'm on the intercom.</p>

<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>Where is the intercom?</p>

<p>It's on the wall</p>
<p>by the two African fellows.</p>

<p>MIA: To your right.</p>

<p>[Singing]... was the son</p>
<p>of a preacher man</p>

<p>The only boy...</p>

<p>MIA: Warm. Warmer. Disco.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>

<p>MIA: Push the button</p>
<p>if you want to talk.</p>

<p>- Hello.</p>
<p>- Go make yourself a drink...</p>

<p>and I'll be down</p>
<p>in two shakes of a lamb's tail.</p>

<p>MIA:</p>
<p>The bar is by the fireplace.</p>

<p>DUSTY SPRINGFIELD SINGING:</p>
<p>Being good isn't always easy</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>[Singing] When he started</p>
<p>sweet-talkin' to me</p>

<p>He'd come and tell me</p>
<p>everything is all right</p>

<p>He'd kiss and tell me</p>
<p>everything is all right</p>

<p>Can I get away again tonight?</p>

<p>The only one</p>
<p>who could ever reach me</p>

<p>Was the son of a preacher man</p>

<p>The only boy</p>
<p>who could ever teach me</p>

<p>Was the son of a preacher man</p>



<p>How well I remember</p>

<p>The look</p>
<p>that was in his eyes</p>

<p>Stealin' kisses</p>
<p>from me on the sly</p>

<p>Takin' time to make time</p>

<p>Tellin' me that he's all mine</p>

<p>Learnin' from</p>
<p>each other's knowin'</p>

<p>Lookin' to see</p>
<p>how much we've grown</p>

<p>who could ever reach me</p>

<p>who could ever teach me</p>

<p>Was the son of a preacher man</p>

<p>RICKY NELSON SINGING:</p>
<p>... lonesome town</p>

<p>To cry my troubles away...</p>




<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>RICKY NELSON SINGING:</p>
<p>... with regret</p>

<p>Think nothin' of it.</p>

<p>RICKY NELSON SINGING:</p>
<p>... lonesome town</p>

<p>I can learn to forget</p>

<p>MIA: So... Marsellus said you</p>
<p>just got back from Amsterdam.</p>

<p>- Sure did.</p>
<p>- MIA: How long were you there?</p>

<p>[Sniffs] Just over three years.</p>

<p>I go there about once a year</p>
<p>to chill out for a month.</p>

<p>No kiddin'? I didn't know that.</p>

<p>Why would you?</p>

<p>I heard you did a pilot.</p>

<p>That was my fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p>It was a show about a team</p>
<p>of female secret agents...</p>

<p>called "Fox Force Five."</p>

<p>- What?</p>
<p>- MIA: "Fox Force Five."</p>

<p>a bunch of foxy chicks.</p>

<p>to be reckoned with.</p>


<p>MIA: There was a blond one...</p>
<p>Sommerset O'Neal.</p>

<p>She was the leader.</p>

<p>The Japanese Fox</p>
<p>was a kung-fu master.</p>

<p>The black girl</p>
<p>was a demolition expert.</p>

<p>French Fox's specialty was sex.</p>

<p>What was your specialty?</p>

<p>Knives.</p>

<p>Raven McCoy...</p>

<p>her background was she grew up</p>
<p>raised by circus performers.</p>

<p>According to the show...</p>

<p>she was the deadliest woman</p>
<p>in the world with a knife...</p>

<p>and she knew</p>
<p>a zillion old jokes.</p>


<p>And if we would've</p>
<p>got picked up...</p>

<p>they would've worked in</p>
<p>a gimmick where every show...</p>

<p>I would've told another joke.</p>

<p>You know any of them old jokes?</p>

<p>to say one...</p>

<p>'cause we only did one show.</p>

<p>- Tell me.</p>
<p>- It's corny.</p>

<p>VINCENT: Don't be that way.</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>

<p>and I'd be embarrassed.</p>

<p>VINCENT: You'd be em...</p>

<p>and you can't tell me?</p>

<p>VINCENT:</p>
<p>I promise I won't laugh.</p>

<p>Vince.</p>

<p>and you know it.</p>

<p>not gonna tell you...</p>

<p>'cause it's been</p>
<p>built up too much.</p>

<p>What a gyp.</p>

<p>BUDDY: Martin and Lewis.</p>

<p>Vanilla Coke.</p>

<p>Mmm. Yummy.</p>

<p>You think</p>
<p>I could have a sip of that?</p>

<p>Be my guest.</p>

<p>tastes like.</p>

<p>You can use my straw.</p>
<p>I don't have cooties.</p>


<p>All right.</p>

<p>fuckin' good milk shake.</p>

<p>Told you.</p>

<p>I don't know</p>

<p>but it was pretty fucking good.</p>

<p>Don't you hate that?</p>

<p>Hate what?</p>

<p>Uncomfortable silences.</p>

<p>MIA: Why do we feel</p>
<p>it's necessary...</p>

<p>to yak about bullshit</p>
<p>in order to be comfortable?</p>

<p>but it's a good question.</p>

<p>That's when you know you've</p>
<p>found somebody really special...</p>

<p>when you can just</p>
<p>shut the fuck up for a minute...</p>

<p>and comfortably share a silence.</p>

<p>we're quite there yet...</p>

<p>but don't feel bad.</p>
<p>We just met each other.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what.</p>

<p>I'm going to go to the bathroom</p>
<p>and powder my nose.</p>

<p>You sit here</p>
<p>and think of something to say.</p>

<p>I'll do that.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>[Men whistling]</p>

<p>[Mia inhaling]</p>

<p>I said goddamn! Goddamn.</p>

<p>[Whispering] Goddamn.</p>

<p>[Toilet flushes]</p>

<p>WOMAN: I need some hair spray.</p>

<p>[Car door slams]</p>

<p>Mmm. Don't you just love it...</p>

<p>when you come back</p>
<p>from the bathroom...</p>

<p>to find your food</p>
<p>waiting for you?</p>

<p>We're lucky</p>
<p>we got anything at all.</p>

<p>I don't think Buddy Holly's</p>
<p>much of a waiter.</p>

<p>Maybe we should've sat</p>
<p>in Marilyn Monroe's section.</p>

<p>Would you like some coffee?</p>

<p>Which one? There's two Monroes.</p>

<p>That is Marilyn Monroe.</p>

<p>That is Mamie Van Doren.</p>

<p>And I don't see</p>
<p>Jayne Mansfield.</p>

<p>She must have the night off</p>
<p>or somethin'.</p>

<p>- Pretty smart.</p>

<p>of somethin' to say?</p>


<p>However...</p>

<p>You seem like</p>
<p>a really nice person...</p>

<p>and I don't want to offend you.</p>

<p>Ooh. This doesn't sound like</p>

<p>gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.</p>

<p>That sounds like you actually</p>
<p>have somethin' to say.</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>But you have to promise</p>
<p>not to be offended.</p>


<p>You can't promise</p>
<p>somethin' like that.</p>

<p>I have no idea</p>
<p>what you're gonna ask me...</p>

<p>so you can go ahead and ask me</p>
<p>what you're gonna ask me...</p>

<p>and my natural response</p>
<p>could be to get offended.</p>

<p>through no fault of my own...</p>

<p>- I would've broken my promise.</p>
<p>- Let's just forget it.</p>

<p>That's an impossibility.</p>

<p>Trying to forget anything</p>
<p>as intriguing as this...</p>

<p>would be an exercise</p>
<p>in futility.</p>

<p>Is that a fact?</p>

<p>isn't it more exciting...</p>

<p>- when you don't have permission?</p>
<p>- VINCENT: All right. All right.</p>


<p>what happened to Antwan?</p>

<p>Who's Antwan?</p>

<p>Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.</p>

<p>He fell out of a window.</p>

<p>Mmm. Mmm.</p>

<p>Another way to say it</p>
<p>would be that he was thrown out.</p>

<p>Another way would be was he was</p>
<p>thrown out by Marsellus...</p>

<p>and yet even another way</p>
<p>is to say...</p>

<p>he was thrown of a window</p>
<p>by Marsellus because of you.</p>

<p>Is that a fact?</p>

<p>It's just what I heard.</p>

<p>- It's just what I heard.</p>
<p>- Who told you?</p>

<p>VINCENT: They.</p>


<p>[Chuckles]</p>

<p>They certainly do.</p>
<p>They certainly do.</p>

<p>What else did they say?</p>

<p>Um...</p>

<p>MIA:</p>
<p>Did it involve the "F" word?</p>


<p>They just said that Antwan</p>
<p>had given you a foot massage.</p>

<p>- And?</p>
<p>- And... and nothin'. That's it.</p>

<p>You heard Marsellus</p>
<p>threw Tony Rocky Horror...</p>

<p>out of a four-story window</p>
<p>for giving me a foot massage?</p>

<p>- VINCENT: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>- And you believe that?</p>


<p>it sounded reasonable.</p>

<p>Marsellus throwing Tony</p>
<p>out of a four-story window...</p>

<p>for massaging my feet</p>
<p>seemed reasonable?</p>


<p>but that doesn't mean it didn't</p>

<p>very protective of you.</p>

<p>A husband being protective</p>
<p>of his wife is one thing.</p>

<p>A husband</p>
<p>almost killing another man...</p>

<p>for touching his wife's feet</p>
<p>is something else.</p>

<p>But did it happen?</p>

<p>MIA: Only thing Antwan</p>
<p>ever touched of mine...</p>

<p>was my hand when he shook it...</p>
<p>at my wedding.</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>nobody knows why Marsellus...</p>

<p>threw Tony out of</p>
<p>that four-story window...</p>

<p>except Marsellus and Tony.</p>

<p>But when you little scamps</p>
<p>get together...</p>

<p>you're worse</p>
<p>than a sewing circle.</p>

<p>Now I want to dance.</p>
<p>I want to win.</p>

<p>Give her the shot.</p>

<p>- Give it to me.</p>
<p>- Here.</p>

<p>Give me that.</p>

<p>Tell me what to do.</p>

<p>OK. You're giving her</p>
<p>an injection of adrenaline...</p>

<p>but she's got a breastplate.</p>

<p>You've got to</p>
<p>pierce through that.</p>

<p>You gotta bring the needle down</p>
<p>in a stabbing motion.</p>

<p>I gotta stab her three times?</p>

<p>No! You don't gotta stab her</p>
<p>three times. Just once.</p>

<p>But hard enough to get through</p>
<p>her breastplate into her heart.</p>

<p>you press down on the plunger.</p>


<p>I'm kind of curious</p>
<p>about that myself.</p>


<p>- Am I gonna kill her?</p>

<p>She's supposed to come</p>

<p>your daddy died</p>
<p>in a P.O.W. camp?</p>

<p>Well... this here</p>
<p>is Captain Koons.</p>

<p>He was in the P.O.W. camp</p>
<p>with Daddy.</p>

<p>[Sighs]</p>


<p>a bunch about you.</p>

<p>of your dad's.</p>

<p>We were in that Hanoi</p>
<p>pit of hell together...</p>

<p>over five years.</p>

<p>Hopefully...</p>

<p>you'll never have to experience</p>
<p>this yourself...</p>

<p>but when two men</p>
<p>are in a situation...</p>

<p>like me and your dad were</p>
<p>for as long as we were...</p>

<p>you take on certain</p>
<p>responsibilities of the other.</p>

<p>If it had been me who'd...</p>

<p>not made it...</p>

<p>Major Coolidge would be talkin'</p>
<p>right now to my son... Jim.</p>

<p>KOONS: But the way</p>
<p>it turned out...</p>

<p>I'm talkin' to you...</p>

<p>Butch.</p>

<p>I got somethin' for ya.</p>

<p>This watch I got here...</p>

<p>was first purchased</p>
<p>by your great-grandfather...</p>

<p>during the First World War.</p>

<p>It was bought</p>
<p>in a little general store...</p>


<p>Made by the first company</p>
<p>to ever make wristwatches.</p>

<p>carried pocket watches.</p>

<p>It was bought by Private</p>
<p>Doughboy Erine Coolidge...</p>

<p>on the day he set sail</p>
<p>for Paris.</p>

<p>This was your great-</p>
<p>grandfather's war watch...</p>

<p>and he wore it every day</p>
<p>he was in that war.</p>

<p>and when he'd done his duty...</p>

<p>he went home</p>
<p>to your great-grandmother...</p>

<p>took the watch off...</p>

<p>put it in an old coffee can...</p>

<p>and in that can it stayed...</p>

<p>Dane Coolidge...</p>

<p>was called upon</p>
<p>by his country...</p>

<p>to go overseas and fight</p>
<p>the Germans once again.</p>

<p>This time they called it</p>
<p>World War II.</p>

<p>Your great-grandfather</p>
<p>gave this watch...</p>

<p>to your granddad for good luck.</p>

<p>wasn't as good as his old man's.</p>

<p>and he was killed...</p>

<p>along with all the other marines</p>
<p>at the Battle of Wake Island.</p>

<p>Your granddad was facing death.</p>

<p>He knew it.</p>

<p>None of those boys</p>
<p>had any illusions...</p>

<p>about ever leaving</p>
<p>that island alive...</p>

<p>the Japanese took the island...</p>

<p>your granddad asked a gunner</p>
<p>on an Air Force transport...</p>

<p>name of Winocki...</p>

<p>a man he had never met</p>
<p>before in his life...</p>

<p>to deliver to his infant son...</p>

<p>who he had never seen</p>
<p>in the flesh...</p>

<p>his gold watch.</p>

<p>your granddad was dead...</p>

<p>but Winocki kept his word.</p>

<p>KOONS:</p>
<p>After the war was over...</p>

<p>he paid a visit</p>
<p>to your grandmother...</p>

<p>delivering</p>
<p>to your infant father...</p>

<p>his dad's gold watch.</p>

<p>This watch.</p>

<p>This watch</p>
<p>was on your daddy's wrist...</p>

<p>when he was shot down</p>
<p>over Hanoi.</p>

<p>put in a Vietnamese prison camp.</p>

<p>He knew that if the gooks</p>
<p>ever saw the watch...</p>

<p>they'd confiscate it...</p>

<p>take it away.</p>

<p>this watch was your birthright.</p>

<p>He'd be damned if any slopes</p>
<p>put their greasy yellow hands...</p>

<p>so he hid it...</p>

<p>in one place he knew he could</p>
<p>hide somethin'... his ass.</p>

<p>Five long years he wore</p>
<p>this watch up his ass.</p>

<p>he give me the watch.</p>

<p>I hid this uncomfortable hunk</p>

<p>Then... after seven years...</p>

<p>I was sent home to my family.</p>
<p>And...</p>

<p>now...</p>

<p>I give the watch to you.</p>

<p>You know what? I was thinkin'</p>
<p>about takin' a shower.</p>

<p>I'm stinkin' like a dog</p>
<p>over here.</p>

<p>Mmm. I like the way you stink.</p>

<p>Let me take this jacket off.</p>

<p>I was looking at myself</p>
<p>in the mirror.</p>

<p>Uh-huh.</p>

<p>I wish I had a pot.</p>

<p>You were lookin' at yourself</p>
<p>in the mirror...</p>

<p>and you wish you had some pot?</p>

<p>A pot.</p>

<p>A pot belly.</p>

<p>Pot bellies are sexy.</p>


<p>'cause you have one.</p>

<p>[Chuckling]</p>

<p>I don't have a pot.</p>

<p>I have a bit of a tummy...</p>

<p>like Madonna</p>
<p>when she did "Lucky Star."</p>

<p>It's not the same thing.</p>

<p>I didn't know</p>
<p>there was such a difference...</p>

<p>between a pot belly and a tummy.</p>

<p>The difference is huge.</p>

<p>[Kisses]</p>

<p>Would you like it</p>
<p>if I had a pot belly?</p>

<p>No. Pot bellies make a man...</p>

<p>look either oafish</p>
<p>or like a gorilla.</p>

<p>a pot belly is very sexy.</p>

<p>The rest of you is normal.</p>


<p>but with a big perfectly</p>
<p>round pot belly.</p>

<p>two sizes too small...</p>

<p>to accentuate it.</p>

<p>You think men</p>
<p>would find that attractive?</p>

<p>I don't give a damn</p>
<p>what men find attractive.</p>

<p>It's unfortunate what we</p>
<p>find pleasing to the touch...</p>

<p>and pleasing to the eye</p>
<p>is seldom the same.</p>

<p>[Sighs]</p>

<p>If you had a pot belly...</p>

<p>I would punch you in it.</p>

<p>- You'd punch me in my belly?</p>
<p>- Right in the belly.</p>

<p>Ah! I'd smother you.</p>

<p>I'd drop it right on your face</p>
<p>till you couldn't breathe.</p>

<p>[Butch laughing]</p>

<p>You'd do that?</p>

<p>Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>[Moans]</p>

<p>[Moaning]</p>


<p>Did you get everything?</p>



<p>Did everything go as planned?</p>

<p>You didn't listen to the... Ow!</p>

<p>[Fabienne chuckles]</p>

<p>You didn't listen to the radio?</p>

<p>I never listen to your fights.</p>

<p>Were you the winner?</p>


<p>FABIENNE:</p>
<p>Are you still retiring?</p>

<p>Sure am.</p>

<p>in the finish?</p>

<p>baby.</p>

<p>Mmm.</p>

<p>aren't we?</p>


<p>will they?</p>

<p>Do you still want me</p>
<p>to go with you?</p>

<p>I don't want to be a burden</p>

<p>[Exhales]</p>

<p>Say it.</p>

<p>Fabienne...</p>

<p>I want you to be with me.</p>

<p>Forever?</p>

<p>Forever and ever.</p>

<p>Do you love me?</p>


<p>[Sighs]</p>

<p>Mmm.</p>

<p>Butch?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Will you give me oral pleasure?</p>

<p>Will you kiss it?</p>

<p>But you first.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>Mmm.</p>

<p>Mmm.</p>

<p>Butch.</p>

<p>Mon amour.</p>
<p>L'aventure commence.</p>

<p>Mmm.</p>

<p>[Fabienne moans]</p>

<p>[Shower running]</p>

<p>[Butch groaning]</p>

<p>BUTCH: I think I cracked a rib.</p>

<p>Giving me oral pleasure?</p>


<p>Don't call me retard.</p>

<p>[Mongoloid voice]</p>
<p>My name is Fabby.</p>

<p>My name is Fabienne.</p>

<p>Stop it. Stop it.</p>

<p>My name is Fabienne.</p>


<p>I hate that mongoloid voice.</p>


<p>[Shuts off water]</p>

<p>I take it back.</p>

<p>Miss Beautiful Tulip?</p>


<p>I like being called a tulip.</p>

<p>Tulip is much better</p>
<p>than mongoloid.</p>

<p>I didn't call you a mongoloid.</p>

<p>and I took it back.</p>

<p>Uhh. [Sniffs]</p>

<p>Butch?</p>


<p>Where are we going to go?</p>


<p>Wherever you want.</p>

<p>We're gonna get</p>
<p>a lot of money from this...</p>

<p>but it ain't gonna be</p>
<p>the kinda money...</p>

<p>that we can live like hogs</p>
<p>in the fat house forever.</p>

<p>I was thinkin' maybe</p>
<p>we could go down...</p>

<p>someplace</p>
<p>in the South Pacific.</p>

<p>The kinda money</p>
<p>we're gonna have...</p>

<p>is gonna carry us</p>
<p>a long way down there.</p>

<p>we could live in Bora Bora?</p>

<p>You betcha.</p>

<p>And if after a while</p>
<p>you didn't dig that...</p>

<p>maybe Tahiti. Mexico.</p>

<p>But I do not speak Spanish.</p>



<p>Donde esta el zapateria?</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>Where is the shoe store?</p>

<p>Donde esta...</p>


<p>[Spits]</p>

<p>[Fabienne brushing teeth]</p>

<p>[Motorcycle driving on TV]</p>

<p>Ohh!</p>

<p>FABIENNE: Merde.</p>

<p>You startled me.</p>

<p>Did you have a bad dream?</p>

<p>Shit.</p>

<p>What is this you're watching?</p>

<p>FABIENNE:</p>
<p>A motorcycle movie.</p>

<p>I'm not sure the name.</p>

<p>Are you watchin' it?</p>

<p>FABIENNE:</p>
<p>In a way.</p>

<p>It's a little early</p>
<p>in the morning...</p>

<p>for explosions and war.</p>

<p>What was it about?</p>

<p>BUTCH:</p>

<p>You were the one</p>
<p>who was watchin' it.</p>

<p>what was your dream about?</p>

<p>I don't know. I don't remember.</p>

<p>It's really rare</p>
<p>that I remember my dreams.</p>

<p>at the grumpy man...</p>

<p>in the morning.</p>

<p>- Mmm.</p>
<p>- Mmm.</p>

<p>FABIENNE: Why don't you get up</p>
<p>and we'll get some breakfast?</p>

<p>and I'll get up.</p>

<p>BUTCH: Mmm.</p>

<p>Satisfied?</p>

<p>Yep.</p>


<p>Ohh.</p>

<p>[Chuckles]</p>

<p>God. Unh.</p>

<p>What time is it?</p>


<p>What time does our train arrive?</p>


<p>You know what I'm gonna</p>
<p>have for breakfast?</p>


<p>I'm gonna order a big plate...</p>

<p>of blueberry pancakes</p>
<p>with maple syrup...</p>

<p>and five sausages.</p>

<p>Anything to drink with that?</p>


<p>[Chuckles]</p>

<p>To drink...</p>

<p>a tall glass of orange juice</p>
<p>and a black cup of coffee.</p>

<p>have a slice of pie.</p>

<p>Pie for breakfast?</p>

<p>FABIENNE: Any time of the day</p>
<p>is a good time for pie.</p>

<p>Blueberry pie</p>
<p>to go with the pancakes.</p>

<p>of melted cheese...</p>

<p>Where's my watch?</p>

<p>FABIENNE: It's there.</p>


<p>FABIENNE:</p>
<p>Have you looked?</p>


<p>What the fuck</p>
<p>do you think I'm doing?</p>

<p>You sure you got it?</p>

<p>Yes. Bedside table drawer.</p>

<p>On the little kangaroo?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It was on the little kangaroo.</p>



<p>but it's not here now.</p>

<p>So where the fuck is it?</p>

<p>Fabienne...</p>

<p>that was my father's</p>
<p>fucking watch.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea</p>
<p>what he had to go through...</p>

<p>to get me that watch?</p>

<p>but he went through a lot.</p>

<p>All this other shit</p>
<p>you could set on fire...</p>

<p>but I specifically reminded you</p>
<p>not to forget the fucking watch!</p>

<p>Now think.</p>

<p>BUTCH: Did you get it?</p>

<p>I believe so.</p>

<p>You believe so?</p>
<p>What the fuck does that mean?</p>

<p>or you didn't get it!</p>

<p>Then I did.</p>

<p>Are you sure?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!</p>

<p>BUTCH: Motherfucker!</p>

<p>- Motherfucker!</p>
<p>- Aah!</p>

<p>BUTCH: Do you know how</p>
<p>fucking stupid you fucking are?</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>It's not your fault.</p>

<p>If you left it</p>
<p>at the apartment...</p>

<p>it's not your fault.</p>

<p>I had you bring</p>
<p>a bunch of stuff.</p>

<p>[Exhales]</p>

<p>but I didn't illustrate...</p>

<p>how personal the watch</p>
<p>was to me.</p>

<p>If all I gave a fuck about</p>
<p>was the watch...</p>

<p>I should've told you that.</p>

<p>are you?</p>

<p>[Sniffles]</p>

<p>I... I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Don't be.</p>

<p>It just means</p>
<p>I can't have breakfast with you.</p>

<p>Why does it mean that?</p>

<p>Because I got to go back to</p>
<p>my apartment and get my watch.</p>

<p>Won't the gangsters</p>
<p>be looking for you there?</p>

<p>Well...</p>

<p>that's what I'm going</p>
<p>to find out.</p>

<p>If they are and I don't think</p>
<p>I can handle it...</p>

<p>BUTCH: then I'll split.</p>

<p>I saw your watch.</p>
<p>I thought I brought it.</p>

<p>I'm so sorry.</p>

<p>BUTCH: Here's some money.</p>

<p>Go out and get those pancakes.</p>
<p>Have a nice breakfast.</p>

<p>I'll take your Honda.</p>

<p>I'll be back before</p>
<p>you can say blueberry pie.</p>

<p>Blueberry pie.</p>

<p>Maybe not that fast...</p>


<p>OK.</p>

<p>Bye.</p>

<p>Bye.</p>

<p>Shit! Of all the fucking things</p>
<p>she could fucking forget...</p>

<p>she forgets my father's watch!</p>

<p>BRETT: [Sobs] Yes!</p>

<p>this passage I got memorized.</p>

<p>It sort of fits the occasion.</p>


<p>"The path of</p>
<p>the righteous man...</p>

<p>"by the inequities</p>

<p>"who in the name</p>

<p>He's getting on my nerves.</p>

<p>JULES: Marvin. Marvin!</p>

<p>I'd knock that shit off</p>
<p>if I was you.</p>

<p>[Door opens]</p>


<p>[Gun clicking]</p>

<p>Why the fuck didn't you tell us</p>
<p>somebody was in the bathroom?</p>

<p>Slip your mind?</p>

<p>You forget someone was in there</p>
<p>with a goddamn hand-cannon?</p>

<p>You see the size</p>
<p>of that gun he fired at us?</p>

<p>It was bigger than him.</p>


<p>VINCENT:</p>
<p>I know. We was lucky.</p>

<p>That shit wasn't luck.</p>


<p>This was divine intervention.</p>

<p>You know what</p>
<p>divine intervention is?</p>

<p>I think so.</p>

<p>That means that God</p>
<p>came down from Heaven...</p>

<p>and stopped the bullets.</p>

<p>JULES: That's right.</p>
<p>That's exactly what it means.</p>

<p>God came down from Heaven...</p>

<p>and stopped</p>
<p>these motherfucking bullets.</p>

<p>I think it's time for us</p>

<p>Don't do that. Don't</p>
<p>fucking blow this shit off.</p>

<p>JULES: What just happened here</p>
<p>was a fucking miracle.</p>

<p>This shit happens.</p>

<p>Wrong. Wrong.</p>
<p>This shit doesn't just happen.</p>

<p>Do you want to continue</p>
<p>this theological discussion...</p>

<p>in a car or in a jailhouse</p>
<p>with the cops?</p>

<p>my friend.</p>

<p>JULES: What happened here</p>
<p>was a miracle...</p>

<p>and I want you to fucking</p>
<p>acknowledge it.</p>


<p>Can we go now?</p>


<p>Shit.</p>

<p>VINCENT: You ever seen</p>
<p>that show "Cops"?</p>

<p>and there was this cop on...</p>

<p>and he was talking</p>
<p>about this gunfight...</p>

<p>he had in a hallway</p>

<p>And he just unloaded</p>
<p>on this guy...</p>

<p>and nothing happened.</p>
<p>He didn't hit nothing.</p>

<p>OK? It was just him</p>
<p>and this guy.</p>



<p>go walk with the shepherd...</p>

<p>are wide fucking open.</p>

<p>What the fuck does that mean?</p>

<p>It means that's it for me.</p>

<p>you can consider my ass retired.</p>

<p>- Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>- Don't blaspheme.</p>

<p>- God damn it.</p>
<p>- I said don't do that.</p>

<p>Why are you fucking</p>
<p>freaking out on us?</p>

<p>Marsellus today.</p>

<p>I'm through.</p>

<p>Why don't you tell him</p>
<p>at the same time why?</p>

<p>Don't worry. I will.</p>


<p>he laughs his ass off.</p>

<p>I don't give a damn</p>
<p>if he does.</p>

<p>of all this?</p>

<p>have an opinion.</p>

<p>You got to have an opinion.</p>

<p>Do you think that God came down</p>
<p>from Heaven and stopped...</p>

<p>[Gunshot]</p>

<p>What the fuck's happening?</p>

<p>I shot Marvin in the face.</p>

<p>Why the fuck did you do that?</p>

<p>It was an accident.</p>

<p>crazy-ass shit in my time...</p>

<p>I told you it was an accident.</p>

<p>You probably... You went over</p>
<p>a bump or something.</p>

<p>no motherfucking bump.</p>

<p>to shoot the son of a bitch.</p>

<p>The gun went off.</p>
<p>I don't know why.</p>


<p>We're on a city street</p>
<p>in broad daylight.</p>


<p>motherfucker.</p>

<p>We got to get this car</p>
<p>off the road.</p>

<p>cops tend to notice shit...</p>

<p>like you're driving a car</p>
<p>drenched in fucking blood.</p>

<p>Just take it</p>


<p>Marsellus ain't got</p>
<p>no friendly places.</p>


<p>- Shit!</p>
<p>- What you doing?</p>

<p>I'm calling my partner</p>
<p>in Toluca Lake.</p>

<p>Where's Toluca Lake?</p>

<p>over by Burbank Studios.</p>

<p>If Jimmie's ass ain't home...</p>

<p>I don't know what the fuck</p>

<p>'cause I ain't got</p>


<p>It's Jules.</p>

<p>Me and my homeboy are in</p>

<p>to get off the road pronto.</p>

<p>I need to use your garage</p>
<p>for a couple hours.</p>

<p>JULES: We got to be</p>
<p>real fucking delicate...</p>

<p>with this Jimmie situation.</p>

<p>He's one remark away from</p>
<p>kicking our asses out the door.</p>

<p>VINCENT:</p>

<p>JULES: We ain't leaving</p>
<p>till we made a couple calls...</p>

<p>but I don't want it</p>
<p>to reach that pitch.</p>

<p>Jimmie's a friend.</p>

<p>You don't come</p>
<p>into your friend's house...</p>

<p>and start telling him</p>
<p>what's what.</p>

<p>VINCENT: Just tell him not</p>

<p>He kind of freaked out</p>
<p>back there when he saw Marvin.</p>

<p>in his position.</p>


<p>He just woke up.</p>
<p>He wasn't expecting this shit.</p>

<p>who's doing who a favor.</p>

<p>VINCENT: If that favor means</p>
<p>that I got to take shit...</p>

<p>then he can stick that favor</p>
<p>straight up his ass.</p>

<p>did you just do to his towel?</p>

<p>VINCENT:</p>
<p>I was drying my hands.</p>

<p>JULES: You're supposed</p>
<p>to wash them first.</p>

<p>You watched me wash them.</p>

<p>I watched you get them wet.</p>

<p>I was washing them.</p>
<p>This shit's hard to get off.</p>

<p>I could've done a better job.</p>

<p>I used the same</p>
<p>fucking soap you did...</p>

<p>and the towel didn't look like</p>
<p>no goddamn maxipad.</p>

<p>What if he was to come in here</p>
<p>and see his towel like this?</p>

<p>It's shit like this</p>
<p>that'll bring this situation...</p>


<p>Look...</p>

<p>I ain't threatening you</p>

<p>You know I respect you</p>
<p>and all...</p>

<p>but just don't put me</p>

<p>All right. Fine. Fine.</p>

<p>no problem.</p>

<p>Just go handle your friend.</p>
<p>Go ahead. I don't care.</p>


<p>This is some</p>
<p>serious gourmet shit.</p>

<p>JULES: Me and Vincent</p>
<p>would've been satisfied...</p>

<p>with some freeze-dried</p>

<p>Heh! And he springs this</p>
<p>serious gourmet shit on us.</p>

<p>What flavor is this?</p>


<p>What?</p>

<p>I don't need you to tell me</p>
<p>how fucking good my coffee is.</p>

<p>I'm the one who buys it.</p>
<p>I know how good it is.</p>

<p>she buys shit.</p>

<p>I buy the gourmet</p>
<p>expensive stuff...</p>

<p>I want to taste it.</p>

<p>But you know what's</p>
<p>on my mind right now?</p>

<p>It ain't the coffee</p>
<p>in my kitchen.</p>

<p>It's the dead nigger</p>
<p>in my garage.</p>

<p>don't even worry about it.</p>

<p>I don't think about anything.</p>
<p>I want to ask you a question.</p>

<p>When you came pulling in here...</p>

<p>did you notice a sign</p>
<p>out in the front of my house...</p>

<p>that said</p>
<p>"Dead Nigger Storage"?</p>

<p>I didn't see no shit...</p>

<p>Did you notice a sign</p>
<p>in the front of my house...</p>

<p>that said</p>
<p>"Dead Nigger Storage"?</p>

<p>No. I didn't.</p>

<p>JIMMIE: You know why</p>
<p>you didn't see that sign?</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>'Cause it ain't there...</p>

<p>'cause storing dead niggers</p>
<p>ain't my fucking business!</p>

<p>to store the motherfucker.</p>

<p>that if Bonnie comes home...</p>

<p>I'm going to get divorced?</p>

<p>no trial separation.</p>

<p>I'm going to get</p>

<p>And I don't want</p>
<p>to get fucking divorced.</p>

<p>I want to help you...</p>

<p>but I don't want to lose</p>

<p>going to leave you.</p>

<p>Jules!</p>

<p>OK?</p>
<p>Don't fucking "Jimmie" me.</p>

<p>There's nothing you're gonna say</p>
<p>that's gonna make me forget...</p>



<p>she comes home from work</p>
<p>in about an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Graveyard shift</p>
<p>at the hospital.</p>

<p>You got to make</p>
<p>some phone calls?</p>

<p>You got to call some people?</p>

<p>the fuck out of my house...</p>

<p>before she gets here.</p>

<p>That's Kool and the Gang.</p>

<p>We don't want</p>
<p>to fuck your shit up.</p>

<p>get them to bring us in.</p>

<p>You're fucking my shit up</p>
<p>right now!</p>

<p>You'll fuck my shit up big time</p>
<p>if Bonnie comes home.</p>

<p>all right?</p>

<p>The phone is in my bedroom.</p>
<p>I suggest you get going.</p>


<p>What do you think she'll do?</p>

<p>she'll freak.</p>

<p>That ain't no kind of answer.</p>


<p>How much?</p>
<p>A lot or a little?</p>

<p>You got to appreciate</p>
<p>what an explosive element...</p>

<p>this Bonnie situation is.</p>

<p>home from a hard day's work...</p>

<p>and finds a bunch</p>
<p>of gangsters in her kitchen...</p>

<p>doing a bunch</p>
<p>of gangster shit...</p>

<p>there ain't no telling</p>
<p>what she's liable to do.</p>

<p>[Gasps]</p>


<p>All I'm doing</p>
<p>is contemplating the "ifs."</p>

<p>I don't want to hear about</p>
<p>no motherfucking "ifs."</p>

<p>All I want to hear</p>
<p>from your ass is...</p>

<p>"You ain't got no problem.</p>
<p>I'm on the motherfucker.</p>

<p>chill them niggers out...</p>

<p>which will be coming directly."</p>

<p>MARSELLUS: You ain't</p>

<p>I'm on the motherfucker.</p>

<p>Go back in there</p>
<p>and chill them niggers out...</p>

<p>who should be coming directly.</p>

<p>You're sending The Wolf?</p>

<p>motherfucker?</p>

<p>that's all you had to say.</p>

<p>WOLF:</p>
<p>Is she the hysterical type?</p>

<p>When is she due?</p>

<p>Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Give me the principals'</p>
<p>names again.</p>

<p>Jules.</p>

<p>Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Vincent.</p>

<p>Jimmie.</p>

<p>Bonnie.</p>

<p>Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>It's thirty minutes away.</p>

<p>I'll be there in ten.</p>

<p>[Doorbell rings]</p>

<p>This is your house?</p>

<p>JIMMIE: Sure is.</p>

<p>I'm Winston Wolf.</p>
<p>I solve problems.</p>

<p>JIMMIE: Good. We got one.</p>

<p>So I heard. May I come in?</p>


<p>WOLF: You must be Jules...</p>

<p>which would make you Vincent.</p>

<p>Let's get down</p>

<p>If I was informed correctly...</p>



<p>WOLF: Your wife Bonnie...</p>

<p>is that correct?</p>

<p>JIMMIE: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>I was led to believe if she</p>
<p>comes home and finds us here...</p>

<p>she wouldn't appreciate it</p>
<p>none too much?</p>

<p>JIMMIE:</p>
<p>She wouldn't at that.</p>

<p>That gives us forty minutes</p>
<p>to get the fuck out of Dodge...</p>


<p>in a car...</p>

<p>minus a head in a garage.</p>
<p>Take me to it.</p>

<p>[Sighs]</p>

<p>- Jimmie?</p>
<p>- Uh-huh.</p>


<p>I thought I smelled</p>
<p>some coffee back there.</p>

<p>Would you make me a cup?</p>


<p>JIMMIE:</p>

<p>lots of sugar.</p>

<p>About the car... is there</p>
<p>anything I need to know?</p>

<p>make a lot of noise?</p>

<p>Is there gas in it?</p>
<p>Anything?</p>

<p>the car is cool.</p>

<p>WOLF: Positive? Don't get me</p>
<p>out there on the road...</p>

<p>I find out</p>
<p>the brake lights don't work.</p>

<p>the motherfucker's tiptop.</p>

<p>WOLF: Good enough.</p>

<p>Let's go back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>[Sighs]</p>

<p>JIMMIE:</p>


<p>Mmm.</p>


<p>stick it in the trunk.</p>

<p>a pretty domesticated house.</p>

<p>That would lead me to believe</p>
<p>that in the garage...</p>

<p>a bunch of cleaners and shit?</p>

<p>Under the sink.</p>

<p>Good. What I need</p>
<p>you two fellas to do...</p>

<p>is take those cleaning products</p>
<p>and clean the inside of the car.</p>


<p>Go in the back seat...</p>

<p>scoop up all those little</p>
<p>pieces of brain and skull.</p>

<p>Get it out of there.</p>
<p>Wipe down the upholstery.</p>

<p>to be spick-and-span.</p>

<p>You don't need to eat off it.</p>
<p>Just give it a good once over.</p>

<p>What you need to take care of</p>
<p>are the really messy parts.</p>

<p>The pools of blood</p>
<p>that have collected...</p>

<p>you got to soak that shit up.</p>

<p>your linen closet.</p>

<p>I need blankets.</p>
<p>I need comforters.</p>

<p>I need quilts.</p>
<p>I need bedspreads.</p>

<p>the darker the better.</p>

<p>No whites. Can't use 'em.</p>

<p>We need to camouflage</p>
<p>the interior of the car.</p>

<p>We're going to line</p>
<p>the front seat and back seat...</p>

<p>and the floorboards</p>
<p>with quilts and blankets.</p>

<p>So if a cop stops us and sticks</p>
<p>his big snout in the car...</p>

<p>the subterfuge won't last...</p>

<p>will appear to be normal.</p>


<p>VINCENT:</p>
<p>"Please" would be nice.</p>

<p>WOLF: Come again?</p>

<p>I said</p>
<p>a "please" would be nice.</p>

<p>I'm not here to say "please."</p>

<p>I'm here to tell you what to do.</p>

<p>And if self-preservation</p>
<p>is an instinct you possess...</p>

<p>you better fucking do it</p>
<p>and do it quick.</p>

<p>I'm here to help.</p>


<p>it ain't like that.</p>

<p>Your help is definitely</p>
<p>appreciated.</p>


<p>I respect you.</p>

<p>I don't like people barking</p>

<p>it's because time is a factor.</p>


<p>and I need you guys to act fast</p>
<p>if you want out of this...</p>

<p>so pretty please</p>
<p>with sugar on top...</p>

<p>clean the fucking car.</p>

<p>Don't be looking at me</p>

<p>I can feel your look.</p>


<p>Green.</p>

<p>Nothing except</p>
<p>for the mess inside.</p>


<p>Nobody who'll be missed.</p>

<p>Thanks a bunch.</p>


<p>JIMMIE: Pretty good.</p>
<p>I got it all here...</p>


<p>understand something.</p>

<p>Winston.</p>

<p>JIMMIE: You got to understand</p>


<p>This is our best linen here...</p>

<p>and it was a wedding present...</p>

<p>from my Uncle Conrad</p>
<p>and my Aunt Ginny...</p>

<p>and they're not with us anymore.</p>

<p>I really want</p>
<p>to help you guys out...</p>

<p>WOLF: Let me ask you</p>

<p>if you don't mind.</p>

<p>JIMMIE:</p>

<p>WOLF: Your Uncle Conrad</p>
<p>and Aunt Ginny...</p>

<p>were they millionaires?</p>

<p>JIMMIE: No.</p>

<p>your Uncle Marsellus is...</p>

<p>and I'm positive</p>
<p>if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...</p>

<p>- Ginny.</p>
<p>- Ginny were here...</p>

<p>they would furnish you</p>
<p>with a whole bedroom set...</p>

<p>which your Uncle Marsellus</p>
<p>is more than happy to do.</p>

<p>I like oak myself.</p>

<p>That's what I have</p>
<p>in my bedroom.</p>


<p>You an oak man?</p>

<p>Oak's nice.</p>


<p>I will never forgive</p>
<p>your ass for this shit.</p>

<p>This is some fucked-up</p>
<p>repugnant shit.</p>

<p>the philosophy...</p>

<p>that once a man admits</p>
<p>that he is wrong...</p>

<p>that he is immediately</p>
<p>forgiven for all wrongdoings?</p>

<p>JULES: Get the fuck out my face</p>
<p>with that shit.</p>

<p>The motherfucker said that shit</p>
<p>never had to pick up...</p>

<p>itty-bitty pieces of skull</p>
<p>on account of your dumb ass.</p>

<p>VINCENT:</p>

<p>I got a threshold</p>
<p>for the abuse that I will take.</p>


<p>And you got me in the red.</p>

<p>I'm just saying</p>
<p>that it's fucking dangerous...</p>

<p>to have a race car</p>

<p>- I could blow.</p>


<p>I'm a mushroom cloud-laying</p>

<p>Every time my fingers touch</p>

<p>I'm "The Guns of the Navarone."</p>

<p>am I doing in the back?</p>

<p>You the motherfucker</p>
<p>who should be on brain detail.</p>

<p>We fucking switching.</p>
<p>I'm washing the windows...</p>

<p>and you picking up</p>
<p>this nigger's skull.</p>


<p>We may get out of this yet.</p>

<p>JIMMIE: I can't believe</p>
<p>this is the same car.</p>

<p>WOLF: Let's not start sucking</p>
<p>each other's dicks quite yet.</p>

<p>Phase one is complete...</p>
<p>clean the car...</p>

<p>which moves us right</p>
<p>along to phase two...</p>

<p>clean you two.</p>

<p>Strip.</p>

<p>All the way?</p>

<p>WOLF: To your bare ass.</p>


<p>WOLF:</p>
<p>We got about fifteen minutes...</p>

<p>before Jimmie's better half</p>
<p>pulls into the driveway.</p>

<p>Damn. This morning air</p>
<p>is some chilly shit.</p>

<p>Are you sure this is</p>
<p>absolutely necessary?</p>

<p>You know what you two</p>
<p>look like?</p>

<p>VINCENT: What?</p>

<p>Like a couple of guys who just</p>
<p>blew off somebody's head.</p>

<p>Stripping off those bloody rags</p>
<p>is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.</p>

<p>JULES:</p>
<p>Don't do nothing stupid...</p>

<p>like leaving this shit out front</p>
<p>for Otto the Garbageman...</p>

<p>you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>We're taking it with us.</p>


<p>- Vincent.</p>

<p>you've both been</p>
<p>to County before I'm sure.</p>

<p>Here it comes.</p>

<p>Goddamn!</p>
<p>The water's fucking cold.</p>

<p>WOLF: Better you</p>

<p>Ha ha ha!</p>

<p>Don't be afraid</p>
<p>of the soap.</p>

<p>Spread it around.</p>

<p>Get him up there</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>

<p>JIMMIE: Vincent's hair.</p>

<p>God damn it! Do it!</p>


<p>Towel 'em.</p>

<p>WOLF: They're dry enough.</p>
<p>Toss them their clothes.</p>

<p>[Wolf laughs]</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>Perfect. We couldn't</p>
<p>have planned this better.</p>

<p>You guys look like...</p>


<p>Dorks.</p>

<p>[Laughs]</p>

<p>They look like</p>
<p>a couple of dorks.</p>

<p>[Both laugh]</p>

<p>We're laughing our way</p>
<p>right into prison.</p>

<p>Don't make me beg.</p>

<p>our rules of the road straight.</p>

<p>We're going to a place called</p>
<p>Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.</p>

<p>and his daughter Raquel...</p>

<p>are sympathetic to our dilemma.</p>

<p>The place is North Hollywood...</p>

<p>we'll be going up Hollywood Way.</p>



<p>of any John Q. Laws...</p>

<p>nobody does a fucking thing</p>
<p>till I do something.</p>

<p>- Right.</p>
<p>- What did I say?</p>

<p>Don't do shit unless...</p>

<p>- Unless what?</p>
<p>- Unless you do it first.</p>

<p>Spoken like a true prodigy.</p>


<p>Can you keep your spurs</p>
<p>from jingling and jangling?</p>

<p>the gun went off.</p>

<p>I don't why.</p>

<p>I'm cool. I promise you.</p>


<p>If I get my car back</p>
<p>any different than I gave it...</p>

<p>Monster Joe's going to be</p>

<p>- We cool?</p>
<p>- Like it never happened.</p>

<p>I'll see you guys around.</p>

<p>I just want to tell you...</p>

<p>it was a real pleasure</p>
<p>watching you work.</p>

<p>Respect for one's elders</p>

<p>I have character.</p>

<p>Because you are a character...</p>

<p>doesn't mean</p>
<p>that you have character.</p>

<p>Want to share a cab?</p>

<p>I could go for some breakfast.</p>

<p>- Thank you.</p>

<p>in control.</p>

<p>Didn't even really get pissed</p>

<p>the filthy motherfuckers.</p>

<p>Pigs sleep and root in shit.</p>

<p>That's a filthy animal.</p>

<p>I ain't eating nothing</p>
<p>that ain't got sense enough...</p>

<p>to disregard its own feces.</p>

<p>How about a dog?</p>
<p>A dog eats his own feces.</p>


<p>But do you consider a dog</p>
<p>to be a filthy animal?</p>

<p>I wouldn't go so far</p>
<p>as to call a dog filthy...</p>

<p>but they're definitely dirty.</p>

<p>But a dog's got personality.</p>
<p>Personality goes a long way.</p>


<p>if a pig had</p>
<p>a better personality...</p>

<p>he would cease to be</p>
<p>a filthy animal.</p>

<p>Is that true?</p>

<p>We'd have to be talking about</p>
<p>one charming motherfucking pig.</p>

<p>[Vincent laughs]</p>

<p>He'd have to be ten times</p>
<p>more charming...</p>

<p>you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>[Laughs]</p>

<p>[Laughs]</p>


<p>You're starting to lighten up.</p>

<p>You been sitting there</p>
<p>all serious and shit.</p>

<p>sitting here thinking.</p>

<p>VINCENT: About what?</p>

<p>About the miracle we witnessed.</p>

<p>The miracle you witnessed.</p>

<p>I witnessed a freak occurrence.</p>


<p>An act of God.</p>

<p>JULES:</p>
<p>And what's an act of God?</p>


<p>God makes the impossible</p>
<p>possible.</p>

<p>But this morning</p>
<p>I don't think qualifies.</p>


<p>Don't you see?</p>
<p>That shit don't matter.</p>

<p>You're judging this shit</p>
<p>the wrong way.</p>

<p>God stopped the bullets...</p>

<p>he found my fucking car keys.</p>

<p>You don't judge shit like this</p>
<p>based on merit.</p>

<p>what we experienced...</p>

<p>was an "According to Hoyle"</p>
<p>miracle...</p>

<p>is insignificant...</p>

<p>but what is significant</p>
<p>is I felt the touch of God.</p>

<p>God got involved.</p>

<p>But why?</p>

<p>fucking with me.</p>

<p>but I can't go back to sleep.</p>

<p>You're serious?</p>

<p>You're really thinking</p>
<p>about quitting?</p>

<p>- The life?</p>
<p>- VINCENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>Most definitely.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>


<p>sitting here contemplating.</p>

<p>this case to Marsellus.</p>

<p>going to walk the earth.</p>


<p>like Caine in "Kung Fu."</p>


<p>And how long do you intend</p>
<p>to walk the earth?</p>

<p>Till God puts me</p>
<p>where he wants me to be.</p>

<p>And what if he don't do that?</p>

<p>then I'll walk forever.</p>

<p>So you decided to be a bum?</p>


<p>You decided to be a bum...</p>

<p>VINCENT: just like all those</p>
<p>pieces of shit out there...</p>

<p>who beg for change...</p>

<p>eat what I throw away.</p>

<p>They got a name</p>

<p>It's called a bum.</p>

<p>or legal tender...</p>

<p>that's what you're</p>

<p>You're going</p>
<p>to be a fucking bum.</p>

<p>where you and I differ.</p>

<p>Garcon!</p>

<p>Coffee!</p>


<p>WAITRESS:</p>
<p>Garcon means boy.</p>

<p>But water into wine. I...</p>


<p>Don't fucking talk to me</p>

<p>If my answers</p>

<p>then you should cease</p>
<p>asking scary questions.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a shit.</p>

<p>Let me ask you something.</p>

<p>VINCENT: When did you</p>
<p>make this decision?</p>

<p>When you were sitting there</p>
<p>eating that muffin?</p>


<p>I was sitting here</p>
<p>eating my muffin...</p>

<p>and drinking my coffee...</p>

<p>and replaying</p>
<p>the incident in my head...</p>

<p>when I had what alcoholics</p>
<p>refer to as a moment of clarity.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>To be continued.</p>

<p>[Music playing softly]</p>

<p>I'm going to come around</p>
<p>and collect your wallets.</p>

<p>You don't fucking talk.</p>

<p>You just throw them in the bag.</p>
<p>Are we clear?</p>


<p>Good. Now wallets out.</p>

<p>PUMPKIN: That's it.</p>
<p>Get the fuck down.</p>

<p>In the bag.</p>

<p>In the fucking bag!</p>

<p>In the bag.</p>

<p>In the bag.</p>

<p>In the bag.</p>

<p>What's in the case?</p>

<p>My boss's dirty laundry.</p>

<p>Your boss makes you</p>
<p>do his laundry?</p>

<p>JULES:</p>
<p>When he wants it clean.</p>

<p>Sounds like a shit job.</p>

<p>Funny.</p>
<p>I was thinking the same thing.</p>

<p>Open it.</p>

<p>Afraid I can't do that.</p>

<p>I didn't hear you.</p>


<p>HONEYBUNNY:</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>

<p>PUMPKIN: Looks like we got</p>
<p>a vigilante in our midst.</p>

<p>HONEYBUNNY:</p>
<p>Shoot him in the face.</p>

<p>but this ain't the first time...</p>

<p>I've had a gun pointed at me.</p>

<p>You don't take your hand off</p>

<p>MANAGER: Stop causing problems!</p>
<p>You'll get us all killed!</p>

<p>Give 'em what you got</p>
<p>and get 'em out of there!</p>


<p>This ain't none</p>
<p>of your goddamn business.</p>


<p>It's no problem.</p>
<p>I got it under control.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to count to three.</p>

<p>If you don't open that case...</p>

<p>I'm going to unload</p>
<p>in your fucking face.</p>

<p>We clear?</p>

<p>One...</p>

<p>two...</p>

<p>- three.</p>

<p>You win.</p>

<p>It's yours.</p>

<p>Open it.</p>

<p>HONEYBUNNY:</p>
<p>What is it?</p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>Is that what I think it is?</p>

<p>Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>It's beautiful.</p>

<p>HONEYBUNNY:</p>

<p>You let him go! You let him go!</p>
<p>Let go of him!</p>

<p>- Tell that bitch to be cool!</p>
<p>- I'm gonna kill you!</p>


<p>- Be cool!</p>

<p>Tell that fuckin' bitch</p>
<p>to chill!</p>

<p>PUMPKIN:</p>

<p>- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!</p>

<p>- Let go of him!</p>
<p>- JULES: Chill!</p>

<p>Tell her it's</p>
<p>going to be all right.</p>

<p>It's going to be all right.</p>

<p>- Promise her!</p>
<p>- I promise!</p>

<p>- Tell her to chill!</p>

<p>- Now tell me her name.</p>
<p>- Yolanda.</p>


<p>JULES: We're not gonna</p>

<p>Don't you hurt him!</p>

<p>Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.</p>

<p>We're all gonna be like</p>
<p>three little Fonzies here.</p>

<p>And what's Fonzie like?</p>

<p>what's Fonzie like?!</p>

<p>He's cool?</p>

<p>- JULES: What?</p>
<p>- Cool.</p>

<p>Correctamundo!</p>

<p>And that's what we're gonna be.</p>
<p>We're gonna be cool.</p>

<p>I'm gonna count to three.</p>

<p>And when I count three...</p>

<p>I want you to let go</p>
<p>of your gun...</p>

<p>put your palms</p>
<p>flat on the table...</p>

<p>and sit your ass down.</p>

<p>you do it cool.</p>

<p>You ready?</p>

<p>One...</p>

<p>two...</p>

<p>three.</p>


<p>you were gonna be cool.</p>

<p>it makes me nervous.</p>

<p>I get scared.</p>

<p>And when motherfuckers</p>
<p>get scared...</p>

<p>that's when motherfuckers</p>
<p>accidentally get shot.</p>


<p>to be the situation.</p>

<p>and you don't want that...</p>

<p>and Ringo here definitely</p>
<p>doesn't want that.</p>

<p>So let's see what we can do.</p>

<p>JULES: Now...</p>

<p>here's the situation.</p>

<p>Normally both your asses...</p>

<p>would be dead</p>
<p>as fuckin' fried chicken...</p>

<p>but you happened</p>
<p>to pull this shit...</p>

<p>while I'm in</p>
<p>a transitional period...</p>

<p>and I don't want to kill you.</p>
<p>I want to help you.</p>

<p>'cause it don't belong to me.</p>

<p>too much shit over this case...</p>

<p>to just hand it over</p>
<p>to your dumb ass.</p>

<p>Vincent!</p>

<p>Be cool!</p>

<p>It's cool!</p>

<p>We still just talking!</p>


<p>Point the gun at me!</p>
<p>There you go.</p>

<p>and don't do a goddamn thing.</p>

<p>Tell her we're still cool.</p>



<p>I... I gotta go pee.</p>
<p>I want to go home.</p>

<p>JULES:</p>

<p>You're doin' great.</p>
<p>I'm proud of you.</p>

<p>And Ringo's proud of you.</p>

<p>It's almost over.</p>

<p>Tell her you're proud of her.</p>


<p>I love you.</p>


<p>I want you to go in that bag</p>
<p>and find my wallet.</p>

<p>Which one is it?</p>

<p>It's the one that says</p>
<p>"Bad Motherfucker."</p>

<p>JULES: That's it.</p>

<p>That's my Bad Motherfucker.</p>

<p>Open it up. Take out the money.</p>

<p>JULES: Count it.</p>

<p>How much is there?</p>


<p>It's yours.</p>

<p>With the rest of those wallets</p>
<p>and the register...</p>

<p>that makes this a pretty</p>
<p>successful little score.</p>


<p>and I'll shoot him</p>
<p>on general principle.</p>


<p>He ain't gonna do a goddamn</p>
<p>motherfuckin' thing.</p>


<p>Shut up!</p>


<p>Vincent.</p>

<p>I'm buyin' somethin'</p>
<p>for my money.</p>

<p>Ringo?</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Your life.</p>

<p>I'm givin' you that money...</p>

<p>so I don't have</p>
<p>to kill your ass.</p>



<p>I got memorized.</p>


<p>"The path of the righteous man</p>
<p>is beset on all sides...</p>

<p>"by the inequities</p>
<p>of the selfish...</p>

<p>"and the tyranny of evil men.</p>

<p>"Blessed is he who in the name</p>
<p>of charity and good will...</p>

<p>"shepherds the weak through</p>
<p>the Valley of Darkness...</p>

<p>"for he is truly</p>
<p>his brother's keeper...</p>

<p>"and the finder</p>
<p>of lost children.</p>

<p>"And I will strike down</p>
<p>upon thee...</p>

<p>"with great vengeance</p>
<p>and furious anger...</p>

<p>"those who attempt to poison</p>
<p>and destroy My brothers.</p>

<p>"and you will know</p>
<p>I am the Lord...</p>

<p>"when I lay My vengeance</p>
<p>upon you."</p>

<p>that shit for years.</p>

<p>that meant your ass.</p>

<p>I never gave much thought</p>
<p>to what it meant.</p>

<p>I just thought</p>
<p>it was some cold-blooded shit...</p>

<p>to say to a motherfucker before</p>
<p>I popped a cap in his ass.</p>

<p>But I saw some shit this mornin'</p>
<p>made me think twice.</p>


<p>maybe it means</p>
<p>you're the evil man...</p>

<p>and I'm the righteous man...</p>

<p>and Mr. Nine-millimeter here...</p>

<p>he's the shepherd</p>
<p>protecting my righteous ass...</p>

<p>in the Valley of Darkness.</p>

<p>Or it could mean...</p>

<p>you're the righteous man</p>
<p>and I'm the shepherd...</p>

<p>and it's the world</p>
<p>that's evil and selfish.</p>


<p>But that shit ain't the truth.</p>

<p>The truth is...</p>

<p>you're the weak...</p>

<p>and I am the tyranny</p>
<p>of evil men.</p>


<p>I'm tryin' real hard</p>
<p>to be the shepherd.</p>

<p>JULES: Go on.</p>

<p>[Sighs]</p>

<p>I think we should</p>
<p>be leaving now.</p>

<p>that's probably a good idea.</p>
